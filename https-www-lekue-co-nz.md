- [Egg Poacher](https://www.lekue.co.nz/products/egg-poacher): Prepare perfect poached eggs the easiest and most effective way with the Egg Poacher. In just 3 minutes! Cleaning is now easier thanks to the new stainless-steel cup. Features Make poached eggs easily using the traditional bain-marie process for a perfect result. The product floats in water for perfect cooking, and you can hold it by the Platinum Silicone top without the danger of getting scalded. The design of the stainless-steel cup keeps the egg in direct contact with the water for quicker cooking. 1. First, heat the water in a pot at 90 to 95º C (the water must not boil). If you wish, you can grease the product with a little oil to make it easier to get the egg out. 2. Place the egg poacher over a glass and break the egg over it. This gets rid of excess condensed liquid through the strainer, it's not the egg white! 3. Close the Egg Poacher securely and place it immediately in the pot for approximately 3 minutes. 4. Then, remove the mould from the water and take out the egg! This system also means you can cook several eggs at the same time because several Egg Poachers fit into one standard pot. Cleaning tips: Clean the Poacher immediately after use or soak it. This will prevent any egg residues from drying in the mould and make cleaning more difficult. If you want to make more than two eggs in a row in the same mould, clean it after the second use.
