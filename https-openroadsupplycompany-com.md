- [Transit Floor Insulation Only](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/transit-floor-insulation-only): Need a floor insulation solution for your Transit conversion? Been scouring the web for a simple drop in solution only to be left scratching your head and more confused than when you started? Problem solved. Enter the AVC Insulation Only Flooring. This product is the bridge between our full insulated floor system and our paper pattern templates. We sourced 1" polyiso acrylic sheet goods and divide the floor up into 12 parts to reduce cost on shipping. The parts are CNCed just like our floor system to key into the ribs on your Ford Transit. This gives you a flat insulated surface 1/2" above your ribs to then apply your subfloor to. We recommend a 1/2" material for your subfloor (Baltic Birch, Advantech, Plywood, etc). Glue the floor down using contact adhesive (we recommend 3M 94), trace/cut your subfloor out, add your choice of finish material (we recommend vinyl floor for a durable seamless finish), trim, and your floor is complete!

- [Sprinter Floor Insulation System and Subfloor](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/sprinter-floor-insulation-system-and-subfloor): Updated material construction as of 12.15.24 Always seeking the best in materials, we found that we could improve quality and keep our costs the same by constructing our panels in house. We bonded 12mm Baltic birch and 1" polyiso foam with 3M 70 construction adhesive. This provides a more resilient flooring substrate with a better bonded layer. We've been installing this floor in house for testing and have been over the moon excited to share it with you. Need a floor insulation solution for your 144 Sprinter conversion? Been scouring the web for a simple drop in solution only to be left scratching your head and more confused than when you started? Problem solved. Enter the AVC Insulated Flooring System. The system includes 3 floor pieces that key into the ribs of the van, 3 trim pieces that finish the edging of the floor, and a custom fabricated step valence that drops in at the entrance of the slider door. The floor is CNC cut using 1-1/2” in house built SIPS panel with 1/2” grooves routed out of the insulated foam so that it keys in to the floor of your van. The height above the top of the ribs is about 1”. The R value of the material is 6.6 so we suspect it may be slightly less than that because we route out some of the foam, but with the contours fitting perfectly to the ribs it creates a well insulated floor. Glue the floor down using contact adhesive, add your choice of finish material (we recommend vinyl floor for a durable seamless finish), and install trim and your floor is complete! $200 FLAT RATE FREIGHT!! Approx Weight: 96lbs Shipped in custom Plywood Crate that can be reused for van building material. Lead Times: 4-6 weeks *Patent Pending

For low roof Sprinters, please contact us to place your order. Please note: There is a pre-cut opening for the factory roof fan location (compatibale with Maxxair fan) in our standard design. However, if you have a different location in mind or want to modify the rack to accommodate your specific roof vent placement, it is possible to do so. Please keep in mind that we don't offer custom cutouts as a standard option, unless the van is brought to our location for rack installation.To perform the cutout yourself, the process is quite straightforward. You would need to cut an opening in the perforated deck and the corresponding crossbar. Once the cutout is made, you can reinforce the area around the cutout by joining the cut crossbar with the crossbars in front of and behind it using aluminum tubes. This reinforcement ensures the structural integrity of the rack even after the modification.

Unlike standard welded boxes, this unit is constructed with no visible welding points, providing a seamless finish that matches the premium look of modern van builds. Designed for versatility, this box features a unique split door system. The top door is supported by dual gas struts for smooth operation, allowing quick access to essentials without exposing the entire contents of the box. The exterior is upgraded with integrated L-Tracks, providing a dedicated mounting interface for recovery boards, tools, or additional accessories. The interior is tailored to the box size: the Large model includes a removable shelf for organized storage, while the Regular model offers a spacious open cavity for bulkier items. To protect your gear, the doors are lined with premium rubber seals to guard against the elements, and the unit is finished with a dual locking system to ensure security on the road. FAQ: 1. Will mounting a box this size damage my rear door hinges or cause the door to sag over time? No, these boxes are relatively lightweight for their volume (48.5 lbs or 64.7 lbs), so they will not damage your hinges. However, please make sure the total weight does not exceed your rack's limit. If you are using our gear rack, the limit is 180 lbs. If you use another brand, please check their specific rating. 2. Does the box obstruct the rear parking sensors or cause the blind spot monitoring system to beep constantly in reverse? This depends on how high you mount it. If it is mounted too low, it might trigger the sensors. You can fix this by mounting the box higher up or adjusting the angle of your sensors. 3. Is this box compatible with existing Sprinter carrier plates from brands like Owl Vans, Aluminess, or other standard panels? This depends on the gear rack. Please check the measurements or contact us before purchasing to ensure it fits your setup. 4. Is the weatherproof seal capable of withstanding high pressure car washes and driving rain at highway speeds? The box is highly weather resistant. It utilizes premium rubber seals to protect against rain and road spray. However, due to the split door design, it does not feature a continuous single piece seal like our regular models. We recommend avoiding direct high pressure water spray at the door seam. 5. Does the box interfere with the rear door opening fully (180° vs 270° hinges) or hitting the side of the van? This depends on your gear rack settings. After installing, check the door opening angle carefully to make sure the box doesn't hit the side of the van. You may need to install a limit stop on your door hinge or use a check strap to stop the door earlier. 6.How secure is the locking mechanism against theft for high value items? The box features a dual point locking system to resist prying, with the option to add secondary padlocks for double security. The aluminum construction further reinforces the unit against forced entry.

TEC Features: Premium anodized surface finish: ensuring a sleek and smooth appearance that seamlessly complements your van's interiors. High strength aluminum: made with super strong and super durable 6061-T6 grade aluminum. Trimmed edges: eliminating rough edges and ensuring a safe, comfortable user experience. TEC Specs: Length: 84” Number of mounting holes: 12 Spacing between mounting holes: Outer six: 8” center to center Central two: 3 1/2” center to center Mounting screw size: M6 socket flat head (Metric) or ¼”-20 flat head Note: mounting screws are not included. Why 84" L Tracks? For 170" Sprinters and 148" extended Transits, you need two 84" tracks to run the lengthwise of the van. For 144" Sprinters and 148" Transits, you need one full 84" track and half of another 84" track to cover the length of the van. This is why we choose to manufacture 84" L tracks: it optimizes material effectiveness, minimizes cutting, and reduces waste.

The structure provides a stable and dependable mounting base for accessories commonly carried on rear doors while keeping overall system weight to a minimum. Installation follows a straightforward, no drill process. The rack mounts directly to the factory hinge locations and utilizes the OEM Mercedes badge openings as a third anchor point. A lower door clamp is included to improve load distribution and overall stability across the door. All installation steps can be completed with standard hand tools, and no modification to the vehicle body is required. The rack features L-track holes and slotted mounting rails, offering compatibility with storage boxes, bike carriers, fuel containers, and other rear door equipment. Its lightweight aluminum frame adds minimal load to the door, keeping door movement consistent under everyday use. FAQ: 1.

One person can complete the installation, though having two people makes the process easier. Typical installation time is around one hour. 4. Will adding gear to the rear door affect hinge durability, door sag, or the door’s ability to open and close normally? No. When installed correctly, the rack does not negatively affect hinge function or door alignment. 5. Can the rear doors open fully with accessories mounted, and are there any interference concerns with the secondary door, ladders, the rear camera, or rear parking sensors? The rear doors can still open fully, and the rack does not interfere with existing equipment such as ladders, cameras, or sensors. 6. Are there any clearance considerations when mounting storage boxes, bikes, or fuel containers—specifically around taillights, hinges, or body panels? Yes. Clearance should be checked based on the size of the accessories being installed to ensure taillights remain visible and sensors are unobstructed.

Climbing surfaces are laid out around a 1.75" side rail that offers a natural, secure hand grip and are paired with ribbed, anti slip step surfaces that maintain footing in wet or muddy environments. The front edge of the steps incorporates cutouts sized for common L-track single stud fittings, allowing additional tie in points or small accessories along the ladder run. Mounted on the side opposite the sliding door, the ladder provides a direct path to roof racks and rooftop gear without interfering with the slider, typical side awnings, or rear door mounted equipment. Installation involves positioning the ladder at the specified mounting points, using the chosen variant to tie into either an existing roof rail or a compatible roof rack on the ladder side, drilling the required holes, and fastening it directly to the van structure with standard tools. Factory or aftermarket roof rails, or a suitable roof rack, are required for installation and are not included. Regular inspections and hardware checks are critical to keeping your side ladder safe and reliable over the long term. After installation, recheck and retighten all hardware at approximately 100 miles, and then every 600 miles thereafter. At the same time, inspect the overall integrity of the ladder every 600 miles or at least once a month, whichever comes first.

The roof rack fits 2007+ Sprinter 144" and 170" high roof models. 2. Does this rack install onto the factory roof mounting points, and does installation require any drilling or modification? The rack mounts directly onto the Sprinter’s factory roof rails. If your vehicle is not equipped with roof rails, a roof rail kit must be installed first. We recommend the Tec Vanlife roof rails sold separately in this store, which install without drilling or permanent modification. 3. Can this roof rack be installed by one person, what tools are required, and how long does installation typically take? Installation can be completed by a single person using basic hex wrenches and a 13 mm wrench. The typical installation time is approximately 2 hours. 4. Is this rack compatible with solar panels, roof decks, and Fiamma awnings out of the box? Yes. Solar panels, Fiamma awnings, and roof decks can be mounted. Mounting accessories requires the appropriate brackets or hardware, which are available separately in this store. 5. Will this roof rack interfere with the factory antenna, roof vents, or cabling channels? No. The crossbars can be positioned freely and will not interfere with vents, AC units, or interior wiring. 6. How does this roof rack affect fuel economy and wind noise at highway speeds? Fuel consumption will increase slightly at highway speeds. In typical installations, there is no noticeable increase in wind noise. Regular inspections and hardware checks are critical to keeping your rack safe and reliable over the long term. Always stay within the maximum roof load specified by the vehicle manufacturer and use all available attachment points on the van roof to distribute weight properly. After installation, recheck and retighten all hardware at approximately 100 miles, and then every 600 miles thereafter. At the same time, inspect the overall integrity of the rack every 600 miles or at least once a month, whichever comes first.

Key Features: Constructed from an aluminum frame and carbon fiber panels for high strength to weight ratio Tall 75" profile accommodates long skis, snowboards, and golf clubs Weighs only 49 lbs (22.2 kg) to minimize load on rear door hinges Includes two removable internal panels for customized storage configuration Zero rust design eliminates corrosion from road salt and snow exposure Carbon fiber panels secured by full perimeter screws for maximum rigidity Premium rubber seal creates a watertight, dustproof barrier against highway driving rain Includes built in locking mechanism with option for secondary padlock Measurements: 19.7" W x 15.7" D x 75.6" H (500 mm x 400 mm x 1920 mm) Weight: 49 lbs (22.2 kg) Description: The Trenta Hybrid Storage Box combines a rigid aluminum frame with carbon fiber side panels to deliver maximum volume with minimal weight. This hybrid construction keeps the unit at just 49 lbs while completely eliminating steel components, ensuring zero rust or corrosion even after prolonged exposure to road salt and winter conditions. Designed for a direct fit to the Sprinter rear door gear rack, the box’s vertical profile is optimized for oversized gear. With a usable internal height of 75 inches (1905 mm), it securely houses skis, snowboards, golf bags, and other long equipment that does not fit in standard square cargo boxes. This model features two removable internal panels, allowing you to secure smaller items or customize the interior layout to fit your specific loadout. The door utilizes a continuous rubber seal to create a watertight and dustproof barrier. This effectively blocks high pressure water spray and rain at highway speeds. For security, a robust locking handle keeps the door tightly closed and your gear safe. FAQ: 1. Will mounting a box this size damage my rear door hinges or cause the door to sag over time? No, the box weighs only 49 lbs, so it will not damage your hinges. However, please make sure the total weight does not exceed your rack's limit. If you are using our gear rack, the limit is 180 lbs. If you use another brand, please check their specific rating. 2. Does the box obstruct the rear parking sensors or cause the blind spot monitoring system to beep constantly in reverse? This depends on how high you mount it. If it is mounted too low, it might trigger the sensors. You can fix this by mounting the box higher up or adjusting the angle of your sensors. 3. Is this box compatible with existing Sprinter carrier plates from brands like Owl Vans, Aluminess, or other standard panels? Due the larger size, this box is not compatible with some gear racks. Please double check the measurements or contact us before purchasing to ensure it fits your setup. 4. Is the weatherproof seal capable of withstanding high pressure car washes and driving rain at highway speeds? Yes, it is waterproof. The rubber seal keeps water and dust out, even during heavy rain or car washes. 5. Does the box interfere with the rear door opening fully (180° vs 270° hinges) or hitting the side of the van? This depends on your gear rack settings. After installing, check the door opening angle carefully to make sure the box doesn't hit the side of the van. You may need to install a limit stop on your door hinge or use a check strap to stop the door earlier. 6.How secure is the locking mechanism against theft for high value items? The box features a dual point locking system to resist prying, with the option to add secondary padlocks for double security. Structurally, the carbon fiber panels are anchored by a full perimeter of screws. This reinforced assembly prevents the panels from being kicked in or pried off the frame.

- [2019+ Sprinter Sliding Door Storage Step](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/2019-sprinter-sliding-door-storage-step): FREE Shipping to Lower 48 states Important Fitment Note:Due to inconsistencies in Mercedes factory manufacturing, we’ve seen sliding doors vary in width by up to 22mm. While it's rare to encounter a significantly narrower door—most fall within normal tolerances—some minor trimming may be required for a perfect fit in select cases. For subfloors thicker than 1 1/4", this product can still be used effectively. Simply add a trim piece between the bottom lip of the storage step and the factory step, and use shims between this product and the factory step to fill any gaps and ensure proper support. If the corner of the storage step contacts the rubber seal around the sliding door, we recommend lightly grinding the corner to create sufficient clearance.

In typical installations, there is no noticeable increase in wind noise. Regular inspections and hardware checks are critical to keeping your rack safe and reliable over the long term. Always stay within the maximum roof load specified by the vehicle manufacturer and use all available attachment points on the van roof to distribute weight properly. After installation, recheck and retighten all hardware at approximately 100 miles, and then every 600 miles thereafter. At the same time, inspect the overall integrity of the rack every 600 miles or at least once a month, whichever comes first.

- [Carbon Fiber Storage Box - Grande | Camper Van Storage](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/carbon-fiber-storage-box-grande-camper-van-storage): Compact and lightweight carbon fiber and aluminum storage box designed for the Sprinter rear door gear rack. - FREE shipping to the lower 48 states. - Download mounting instructions [PDF] Secure, weather sealed protection for essential gear such as recovery tools, power cords, and camping accessories. Key Features: Constructed from an aluminum frame and carbon fiber panels for high strength to weight ratio Compact 23" profile creates ideal storage for smaller essentials without obstructing rear views Weighs only 20.9 lbs (9.5 kg) to minimize load on rear door hinges Zero rust design eliminates corrosion from road salt and snow exposure Carbon fiber panels secured by full perimeter screws for maximum rigidity Premium rubber seal creates a watertight, dustproof barrier against highway driving rain Includes built in locking mechanism with option for secondary padlock Measurements: 19.7" W x 15.7" D x 23.6" H (500 mm x 400 mm x 600 mm) Weight: 20.9 lbs (9.5 kg) Description: The Grande carbon fiber and aluminum storage box combines a rigid aluminum frame with carbon fiber side panels to deliver high strength with minimal weight. This hybrid construction keeps the unit at just 20.9 lbs while completely eliminating steel components, ensuring zero rust or corrosion even after prolonged exposure to road salt and winter conditions. Designed for a direct fit to the Sprinter rear door gear rack, the box’s compact profile is optimized for exterior storage without obstructing rear visibility. With internal dimensions tailored for essential gear, it securely houses recovery tools, power cords, and camping accessories that are better stored outside the vehicle. The small footprint preserves space on the carrier plate for additional equipment like tire carriers or bike racks. The door utilizes a continuous rubber seal to create a watertight and dustproof barrier. This effectively blocks high pressure water spray and rain at highway speeds. For security, a robust locking handle keeps the door tightly closed and your gear safe. FAQ: 1. Will mounting a box this size damage my rear door hinges or cause the door to sag over time? No, the box weighs only 20.9 lbs, so it will not damage your hinges. However, please make sure the total weight does not exceed your rack's limit. If you are using our gear rack, the limit is 180 lbs. If you use another brand, please check their specific rating. 2. Does the box obstruct the rear parking sensors or cause the blind spot monitoring system to beep constantly in reverse? This depends on how high you mount it. If it is mounted too low, it might trigger the sensors. You can fix this by mounting the box higher up or adjusting the angle of your sensors. 3. Is this box compatible with existing Sprinter carrier plates from brands like Owl Vans, Aluminess, or other standard panels? This depends on the gear rack. Please check the measurements or contact us before purchasing to ensure it fits your setup. 4. Is the weatherproof seal capable of withstanding high pressure car washes and driving rain at highway speeds? Yes, it is waterproof. The rubber seal keeps water and dust out, even during heavy rain or car washes. 5. Does the box interfere with the rear door opening fully (180° vs 270° hinges) or hitting the side of the van? This depends on your gear rack settings. After installing, check the door opening angle carefully to make sure the box doesn't hit the side of the van. You may need to install a limit stop on your door hinge or use a check strap to stop the door earlier. 6.How secure is the locking mechanism against theft for high value items? The box features a secure locking handle system to resist prying, with the option to add secondary padlocks for double security. Structurally, the carbon fiber panels are anchored by a full perimeter of screws. This reinforced assembly prevents the panels from being kicked in or pried off the frame.

High pressure molded aluminum extrusions form robust, one piece side profiles with double thick corners and reinforced side rails to support awnings and other heavy rooftop equipment without compromising stability. Instead of bent aluminum sections with multiple weak points, the rack uses continuous aluminum profiles that maintain structural integrity along the full length of the van. Crossbars slide and reposition to work around solar panels, roof fans, A/C units, cargo boxes, and other accessories, allowing full use of the High Roof space. The front fairing, together with a deliberate gap between the fairing and the van body, smooths airflow to reduce turbulence and wind noise while driving and to improve cooling beneath solar panels when parked. Laser cut openings in the sidewalls further reduce weight and promote airflow around roof mounted components without compromising strength. All required mounting hardware to attach the rack to roof rails is supplied, and installation can be completed using standard tools. Compatible roof rails (including Mercedes OEM or aftermarket equivalents) are required for installation and are not included. Accessory items such as roof decks and Starlink brackets are available as addons. FAQ: 1. Which Sprinter models and years does this roof rack fit? The roof rack fits 2007+ Sprinter 144" and 170" high roof models. 2. Does this rack install onto the factory roof mounting points, and does installation require any drilling or modification? The rack mounts directly onto the Sprinter’s factory roof rails. If your vehicle is not equipped with roof rails, a roof rail kit must be installed first. We recommend the Tec Vanlife roof rails sold separately in this store, which install without drilling or permanent modification. 3. Can this roof rack be installed by one person, what tools are required, and how long does installation typically take? Installation can be completed by a single person using basic hex wrenches and a 13 mm wrench. The typical installation time is approximately 2 hours. 4. Is this rack compatible with solar panels, roof decks, and Fiamma awnings out of the box? Yes. Solar panels, Fiamma awnings, and roof decks can be mounted. Mounting accessories requires the appropriate brackets or hardware, which are available separately in this store. 5. Will this roof rack interfere with the factory antenna, roof vents, or cabling channels? No. The crossbars can be positioned freely and will not interfere with vents, AC units, or interior wiring. 6. How does this roof rack affect fuel economy and wind noise at highway speeds? Fuel consumption will increase slightly at highway speeds. In typical installations, there is no noticeable increase in wind noise. Regular inspections and hardware checks are critical to keeping your rack safe and reliable over the long term. Always stay within the maximum roof load specified by the vehicle manufacturer and use all available attachment points on the van roof to distribute weight properly. After installation, recheck and retighten all hardware at approximately 100 miles, and then every 600 miles thereafter. At the same time, inspect the overall integrity of the rack every 600 miles or at least once a month, whichever comes first.

Trimmed edges: eliminating rough edges and ensuring a safe, comfortable user experience. TEC Specs: Length: 84” Width: 1 3/4" Height: 3/8” Number of mounting holes: 12 Spacing between mounting holes: Outer six: 8” center to center Central two: 3 1/2” center to center Mounting screw size: M6 socket flat head (Metric) or ¼”-20 flat head Note: mounting screws are not included. Why 84" L Tracks? For 170" Sprinters and 148" extended Transits, you need two 84" tracks to run the lengthwise of the van. For 144" Sprinters and 148" Transits, you need one full 84" track and half of another 84" track to cover the length of the van. This is why we choose to manufacture 84" L tracks: it optimizes material effectiveness, minimizes cutting, and reduces waste.

- [Aluminum Storage Box - Trenta - Multisport / Ski box](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/aluminum-storage-box-trenta-multisport-ski-box): Heavy duty all aluminum storage box designed for the Sprinter rear door gear rack. - $200 flat rate shipping to the Lower 48 states. Free warehouse pickup available. - Download mounting instructions [PDF] Secure, weather sealed protection for long equipment such as skis, snowboards, golf bags, fishing rods, and recovery gear. Key Features: Constructed from 3mm thick aluminum with a fully welded body for maximum durability Tall 75" profile accommodates long skis, snowboards, and golf clubs Fully welded design eliminates body seams and joint seals for superior waterproofing Equipped with 4 door mounted L-tracks for securing gear and accessories Features two removable internal panels for customized storage configuration Premium rubber seal creates a watertight, dustproof barrier against highway driving rain Weighs 99 lbs (45 kg) for heavy duty applications Includes built in locking mechanism with option for secondary padlock Measurements: 19.7" W x 15.7" D x 75.6" H (500 mm x 400 mm x 1920 mm) Weight: 99 lbs (45 kg) Description: The Trenta Aluminum Storage Box utilizes a fully welded 3mm aluminum body to deliver maximum impact resistance and durability. Unlike hybrid or riveted boxes, this unit features a seamless welded construction that eliminates the need for body seals, ensuring water cannot enter through panel joints even after years of vibration and offroad use. Designed for a direct fit to the Sprinter gear rack, the box’s vertical profile is optimized for oversized gear. With a usable internal height of 75 inches (1905 mm), it securely houses skis, snowboards, golf bags, and other long equipment that does not fit in standard square cargo boxes. This model features two removable internal panels and four door mounted L-tracks, allowing you to secure smaller items or customize the interior layout to fit your specific loadout. The door utilizes a continuous rubber seal to create a watertight and dustproof barrier. This effectively blocks high pressure water spray and rain at highway speeds. For security, a robust locking handle keeps the door tightly closed and your gear safe. FAQ: 1. Will mounting a box this size damage my rear door hinges or cause the door to sag over time? The box weighs 99 lbs. While the door hinges can support this load, you must be careful not to exceed your gear rack's weight limit. If you are using our gear rack, the limit is 180 lbs, leaving roughly 80 lbs for gear. If you use another brand, please verify their load limit first. 2. Does the box obstruct the rear parking sensors or cause the blind spot monitoring system to beep constantly in reverse? This depends on how high you mount it. If it is mounted too low, it might trigger the sensors. You can fix this by mounting the box higher up or adjusting the angle of your sensors. 3. Is this box compatible with existing Sprinter carrier plates from brands like Owl Vans, Aluminess, or other standard panels? Due the larger size, this box is not compatible with some gear racks. Please double check the measurements or contact us before purchasing to ensure it fits your setup. 4. Is the weatherproof seal capable of withstanding high pressure car washes and driving rain at highway speeds? Yes, it is waterproof. The rubber seal keeps water and dust out, even during heavy rain or car washes. 5. Does the box interfere with the rear door opening fully (180° vs 270° hinges) or hitting the side of the van? This depends on your gear rack settings. After installing, check the door opening angle carefully to make sure the box doesn't hit the side of the van. You may need to install a limit stop on your door hinge or use a check strap to stop the door earlier. 6.How secure is the locking mechanism against theft for high value items? The box features a dual point locking system to resist prying, with the option to add secondary padlocks for double security. The aluminum construction further reinforces the unit against forced entry.

Built from aluminum with TIG welded joints, it forms a rigid structure that resists flex and movement on the road, with the material keeping weight down for everyday use in a range of weather conditions. Climbing surfaces are laid out around a 1.75" side rail that offers a natural, secure hand grip and are paired with ribbed, anti slip step surfaces that maintain footing in wet or muddy environments. The front edge of the steps incorporates cutouts sized for common L-track single stud fittings, allowing additional tie in points or small accessories along the ladder run. Mounted on the side opposite the sliding door, the ladder provides a direct path to roof racks and rooftop gear without interfering with the slider, typical side awnings, or rear door mounted equipment. Installation involves positioning the ladder at the specified mounting points, using the chosen variant to tie into either an existing roof rail or a compatible roof rack on the ladder side, drilling the required holes, and fastening it directly to the van structure with standard tools. Factory or aftermarket roof rails, or a suitable roof rack, are required for installation and are not included. Regular inspections and hardware checks are critical to keeping your side ladder safe and reliable over the long term. After installation, recheck and retighten all hardware at approximately 100 miles, and then every 600 miles thereafter. At the same time, inspect the overall integrity of the ladder every 600 miles or at least once a month, whichever comes first.

Why 84" L Tracks? For 170" Sprinters and 148" extended Transits, you need two 84" tracks to run the lengthwise of the van. For 144" Sprinters and 148" Transits, you need one full 84" track and half of another 84" track to cover the length of the van. This is why we choose to manufacture 84" L tracks: it optimizes material effectiveness, minimizes cutting, and reduces waste.

- [Sprinter Roof Rails / Roof Tracks](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/sprinter-roof-rails-roof-tracks): Direct fit roof rail kit for 2007+ Sprinter vans engineered to support roof racks, solar panels, and other rooftop equipment through a straightforward bolt on installation. - FREE shipping to the lower 48 states. - Download installation instructions [PDF] Key Features: Heavy duty Aluminum extrusion construction Fits 2007+ Mercedes Sprinter 144" and 170" models Direct mount design using factory roof holes Easy bolt alignment during installation Rigid base for racks, solar panels, lighting, and other accessories Powder coated or anodized finish options Straightforward installation with standard tools Compatible with urethane or butyl weather sealing tape Mounting hardware included Measurements: 144": 114.6" (2910 mm) 170": 152.0" (3860 mm) Description: The Tec Vanlife Heavy Duty Roof Rail Kit is manufactured from a high strength aluminum extrusion specifically engineered for 2007+ Sprinter 144" and 170" models. The rails provide a rigid and dependable mounting base suitable for roof racks, crossbars, solar panels, lighting, and other rooftop equipment commonly used in van conversions. Installation follows a simple, direct bolt on process. After removing the factory roof caps to expose the OEM roof holes, the supplied bolts are inserted through these openings from above. The rails are then positioned over the bolts and secured from inside the vehicle using the included washers and self locking nuts. The entire installation can be completed using standard tools. The kit is offered in Anodized Black and Satin Silver. Both finishes provide excellent corrosion resistance and long term durability. For additional weather protection, urethane or butyl tape can be applied around the fasteners during installation. FAQ: 1. Do the mounting holes already exist on the Sprinter roof, or do I need to drill new ones? No drilling is required. Remove the factory plastic covers to access the OEM mounting holes. 2. Do I need to remove the interior ceiling panels to access the roof mounting points? Yes. The interior ceiling panels need to be removed to access the mounting points from the inside and tighten the nuts. 3. Can this roof rail be installed by one person? How long does installation typically take? Two people are recommended. Installation takes around 30 minutes. 4. What tools or sealants are recommended to ensure the roof rail installation is fully waterproof? The kit includes weather sealing strips. No additional sealant is required. 5. Can I mount solar panels, awnings, a roof deck, or other rooftop accessories on these roof rails, and will additional hardware be required? Yes. Mounting accessories requires the appropriate brackets or hardware, which are available separately in this store. 6. Are there any installation differences between Sprinter 144" and 170" models, or between high roof and low roof versions? Installation is identical across all models; only the rail length differs.

- [MegaPro Tow Hitch 5000kg - Tow Bar Mounted Recovery Hitch](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/megapro-tow-hitch-5000kg-tow-bar-mounted-recovery-hitch): The Carbon Offroad MegaPro Tow Hitch Receiver Recovery Point is a premium, versatile recovery solution designed to fit various 50mm receiver hitches. Its adjustable mounting options cater to both shallow and deep-style hitches, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of vehicles. Crafted from high-grade 6061 T6 aluminium and precision CNC machined, this recovery point boasts a durable and aesthetically pleasing finish. The Type 3 hard anodized coating provides exceptional corrosion resistance for long-lasting performance. At a mere 1.2kg, it's significantly lighter than many comparable options on the market. The MegaPro Hitch features a smooth-edged shackle mount, designed for safe use with synthetic rope soft shackles. It can also accommodate a Carbon Offroad 4.25T Bow Shackle, offering flexibility in attachment methods. Mounting Options and Versatility When using the MegaPro Hitch, you can choose between horizontal and vertical shackle point orientations. This flexibility allows for optimal recovery scenarios, regardless of the vehicle's position or the angle of pull. Upward-facing shackle point: Enables lateral movement, ideal for situations where the recovering vehicle is not directly in front of the one being recovered. Sideways-facing shackle point: Allows for vertical movement, accommodating recoveries on inclines or declines. Testing and Durability The MegaPro Hitch underwent rigorous Nata-accredited testing by Mechtest in Brisbane, Australia. While the mounting pin failed at nearly 20 tonnes, the recovery point itself remained intact, demonstrating exceptional strength and durability. The only damage sustained was a slight deformation to the hitch due to the bent pin.

Meet the Sandbar Roof Rack — the perfect way to haul your gear up top and keep your Sprinter’s interior wide open. Built from superior-grade aluminum, this rack stays light, strong, and rust-free. The 3/16" aluminum air deflector isn’t just sleek. It creates a rock-solid mounting point for SV Off-Road Lights and helps cut wind noise. And the real magic? Our dual-height crossbars. Set your solar panel on the lower position, then raise the next bar so your surfboard rides above it. Yes, your board will cast some shade, but the panel keeps working and your gear stays organized. No stacking. No stress. Add our optional decking panels and you’ve got a sturdy, walkable rooftop for loading gear or catching that sunset. Perfect for rooftop tents, boards, kayaks, luggage, solar setups, and hangouts. Why the Sandbar Stands Out 3/16" Aluminum Air Deflector: Rigid, quiet, and strong enough to mount off-road lights. Dual-Height Crossbars: Mount solar down low, then use the higher position for boards and gear. It will shade the panel a bit, but everything still fits clean. Walkable Decking Panels: Optional panels create a safe, stable platform. Modular & Adjustable: All crossbars slide to match your roof layout. Lightweight, No Rust: All-aluminum build made for real travel. Low-Profile Style: Clean lines with a quiet ride. Supports 600 lbs (evenly distributed): Strong enough for all the fun. DIY Friendly: Minimal tools needed. Install video included. Lighting Ready: Exterior lights mount right to the rack rails. Awning Compatible: Works with most awnings (pictured with Fiamma F45s).

- [Star Systems Twin - Apex Custom](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/star-systems-twin-apex-custom): The Star Systems Fin was was designed in the late 1970's as one of the first tool-less fin systems.

A second screw in version of the fins was briefly used but it had another set of problems which let to the discontinuation of the fin boxes these fins used.Many popular collectors board have the Star Systems box and in collaboration with Bird Huffman of Birds Surf Shed we've recreated the original twin template with modern foiling for increased performance over the original fins.

With Akila being a twin guy and Duke leaning more towards quads, Duke wanted to design a quad set that felt like it was in between the twin and quad world. The sensation of quad drive and twin pivot was achieved by scaling down the Ahi twin for the forward and balancing it out with a full, small upright rear.This configuration is best surfed in up to head high surf. Switch out the upright rear for the Horsemen rear for additional holding power in overhead surf.This fin also is suggested for the Genome (overall) and the Wrecking Ball (on smaller days).

- [Ola (6.0" - 10.5") - Apex](https://openroadsupplycompany.com/products/ola-6-0-10-5-apex): The Ola series is a result of a collaboration with Michele Puliti of Ola Surfboards. The classic outline was inspired by the master, and iconic innovator George Greenough. True to Greenough's highly developed understanding of hydrodynamics and performance, the Ola template was designed with a flared base and moderate rake, providing drive and stability. A progressively tapered outline and flexible tip enhances maneuverability and playfulness through turns.The Apex Ola's are CNC cut using G10 fiberglass for incredible flex and rebound. The Ola is highly versatile longboard fin that will work well in most any surfboard: classic noseriders, high performance longboards, mid-lengths, eggs, and smaller 2 plus 1 fun-boards. Most people describe the feeling as free and fluid. Add a pair of side bites for increased stability and control down the line.
