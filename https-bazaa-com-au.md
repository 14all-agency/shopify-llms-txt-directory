- [19th century Box with Miniature Portrait](https://bazaa.com.au/products/19th-century-box-with-miniature-portrait): A beautiful 19th century brass pill or snuff box, decorated with a very pretty miniature portrait on porcelain. The portrait is signed ‘Brodel’ who I believe to be Ernst Brodel, and is stamped on the back as the Duchess of Exeter after Thomas Gainsborough. However, I think this is incorrect as there was no Duchess of Exeter in Gainsborough’s time. A closer match would be Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. The portrait is of her likeness.  The box measures 9.5cm in length and 8cm across. 19th century Box with Miniature Portrait | Bazaa | Vintage, Second-Hand Designer, Pre-Owned and Antique Furniture

- [Hewitt Universal light](https://bazaa.com.au/products/hewitt-universal-light): This is a BIG light. Originally a 2k (2000 watt) Fresnel, the light is now illuminated by a standard screw-in globe. The resultant light projection, regardless of power, is enchanting and suitable for a wide range of settings. You could even put a smart globe and change the colours with your phone if you are so inclined. Made by Hewitt Universal in Sunbury-on-Thames, the light is an English version of the Mole Richardson. Mole Richardson were based in Los Angeles and became the standard for Hollywood. Fresnel refers to the lens, which was originally designed for use in Lighthouses by Augustin-Jean Fresnel following progress made by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon around 1820. The Fresnel lens is defined by its stepped shape or concentric rings. The stepped lens is significantly lighter than a standard lens and enables large apertures with short focal lengths. So get your own miniature lighthouse for your home and shine some beautiful light wherever you wish. Excellen..

Fellini's third film as director &amp; writer, I Vitelloni is frequently regarded as one of his best movies and the first of his classics. The movie's plot focusses on a group of young men living in a small seaside town, who struggle with immaturity and boredom as the excitement of summer passes.

The poster is in good condition with a single fold in the middle and some discolouring on the edges.

- [George Nelson for Herman Miller coffee table](https://bazaa.com.au/products/george-nelson-for-herman-miller-coffee-table): Quite a rare find, this gorgeous George Nelson for Herman Miller coffee table stands 54.5cm high with a diameter of 75cm.It's in lovely vintage condition with a few scuffs and marks here and there, all consistent with the age. Likely made in the 60s or 70s, the top may not be the one it had when it left the US, but shows all the hallmarks of a Herman Miller original - high quality white laminate over wood, with a thick rubber band running around the circumference. Very durable, easy to maintain and easy to swap the top for one of your own to match your interior colour scheme.

- [Fox & Wedge Vintage](https://bazaa.com.au/collections/fox-wedge-vintage): Fox & Wedge VintageA Love for Mid-Century Design, A Belief in a Beautiful Home.Based in our Torquay studio, on the beautiful lands of the Wadawurrung people, Fox & Wedge Vintage is a local family business born from a lifelong passion. We source, restore, and curate exceptional Mid-Century Modern (MCM), retro, and vintage furniture, driven by a deep love for the era's timeless design, clean lines, and connection to organic materials.Our journey began with a simple yet powerful belief: that iconic design shouldn't be confined to galleries or collectors' homes — it should be lived with and loved. What started as a quest for celebrated Australian furniture soon led us further afield. We ventured to Europe and beyond, not just to find rare pieces, but to rescue stories — to bring back furniture whose timeless beauty and thoughtful craftsmanship could enrich homes right here in Australia.Our Philosophy: Lasting Design Over Fast FurnitureIn a world saturated with disposable "fast furniture," we champion an alternative: design that lasts for generations. There's an incredible honesty to Mid-Century Modern, retro, and vintage furniture; it was designed for people – for living, for families, and for comfort.The iconic Australian, Danish, and Scandinavian pieces we adore were built to endure with an integrity that feels more relevant than ever. By restoring these classics, we're not just preserving beauty; we're honouring a more sustainable way of life. A beautifully revived teak armchair or a Danish dining table isn't just an eco-conscious choice – it's a piece of design history, ready to begin its next chapter with you.Beyond the Furniture: Our Partnership with GreenfleetOur commitment to sustainability extends beyond the pieces themselves. For every piece of furniture that finds a new home, we proudly partner with Greenfleet to plant a native tree right here in Victoria. This tangible action helps to restore our local ecosystems, combatting the waste created by the fast furniture industry and ensuring a greener future.Our Restoration Promise: Meticulous and MindfulEvery piece that enters our collection undergoes careful, expert restoration in our Torquay studio. We see ourselves as custodians of these timeless designs, and our process is a delicate balance of preservation and renewal.Honouring the Original Vision:We work to preserve the true soul of each piece, ensuring our restorations enhance – never erase – its unique character and rich historyConscious Materials: We meticulously select premium, non-toxic oils, waxes, and finishes, with a strong preference for natural options.This commitment ensures the result is beautiful without compromise to your home, your family, or the environment.Revive for Another Lifetime: We restore for both enduring beauty and lasting durability, ensuring your furniture remains functional, stunning, and ready to be a cherished part of your story for generations to come.Soul in Every PieceThere's an irreplaceable feeling that comes with vintage design – the subtle marks of a life well-lived, the rich warmth of aged teak, the undeniable soul of an object that has journeyed through time. For us, the clean, functional beauty of Danish and Scandinavian modernism isn't just an aesthetic; it's a way to create calm, uncluttered spaces that feel both inspiring and grounding.Our passion is finding these genuine gems and giving them a new chapter in a modern home. We invite you to explore the stories held within our collection, and hope you discover the perfect piece to enrich your home with character and soul.
