- [JENNA BROCKETT - First Signs](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/jenna-brockett-first-signs): Children understand hundreds of words and concepts before they can communicate verbally, and teaching basic signs to children benefits both them and their parents by providing a means of communication before and during speech development. â€œFirst Signsâ€ contains 13 New Zealand Sign Language signs with details and illustrations on how to do them to get you started. TheseÂ key signs will help you communicate with your little one, easing frustration [for everyone!] by giving them a means to express their wants and needs. You can begin introducing signs as early as you want, the earlier you do means more practice for you but studies show babies as young as six months old can remember and recognise a sign. By eight months some children are able to imitate gestures or communicate using simple one-word signs. Board Book 16 x 16 13 pages 6M+

- [SILLY SILAS Wooly Footless Tights - Cream Blend](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/silly-silas-footless-tights-cream-blend-1): A beautiful neutral colour created by a blend of raw white and creamy beige.The footless wooly tights with braces have the softest feel, keeping your little one warm and cozy during any winter adventure.The unique combination of 59% merino wool and 41% organic cotton ensures the best comfort and thanks to its 100% natural fibers composition, it is suitable for the most sensitive baby skin. Merino wool is ultra-fine, supremely soft natural fiber that is breathable and helps to regulate the body temperature in both warm and cold weather. In the winter days, it absorbs the cold air and circulates the warmth. In summer days, it lets the body breathe while absorbing water from your little onesâ€™ skin. It is also renewable and biodegradable. Thanks to its protein based composition, merino wool biodegrades after about a year in the ground.Our merino wool comes from non-mulesed sheep and is certified to the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS). The RWS describes and independently certifies animal welfare practices in wool production from the farm to the final product.Manufactured with love in Spain, in a local family production with a knitting tradition of more than 50 years. Preserving this beautiful craft that is slowly and sadly vanishing in the area that was well known for textile production in the past.Certified by OEKO-TEXÂ® Standard 100 at the Class 1 level, the most rigorous certification designed specifically for newborns through toddlers up to the age of three.*Important:It is important that your little one always wears the tights with braces in the correct way (as shown in all our pictures) - with one brace securely placed on the left shoulder and the other brace on the right shoulder in order to avoid abrasions.The braces help the little adventurers to freely move while playing and exploring the world and should be always used in the correct position.This is not a sleepwear product, remember to not leave your child unattended when wearing tights with braces.

Letâ€™s face it, itâ€™s FRAGILE AF down there! Your peri wash bottle helps dilute your urine to prevent stinging and infection. We know it looks weird, but honestly, it will be one of your go-to-best-things-ever to take care of down there after baby is born. When toilet paper feels like sandpaper, use your peri wash bottle on your stitches or tears for the first couple of weeks following your birth. Your vagina and perineum are working double-time to repair themselves. Give them a little extra help by using our easy and portable postpartum cleansing peri wash bottle.

- [JENNA BROCKETT First Signs - Animals](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/jenna-brockett-first-signs-animals): Children understand hundreds of words and concepts before they cancommunicate verbally and teaching them signs gives you and your littleone a helping hand as they connect with the world around them, developinterests, and (most importantly) learn basic language skills. ‘First Signs - animals’ paves the way with some favourite animal signs asa fun extension or introduction to pre-verbal communication skills. You can begin introducing signs as early as you want, but studies show that babies as young as six months old can remember and recognise a sign. By eight months, some children are able to imitate gestures or communicate using simple one-word signs. Keep eye contact as you sign and say the word out loud, using the sign in direct context-sign dog when you see a dog in real life or in a book, and repeat the sign every time you see the animal. It’s very likely that your child will invent their own signs or usevariations of a sign you use. If they do, that’s fine. Keep using the ‘official’ sign and let them do their sign. Using sign language as a pre-verbal aid is all about the joy of communicating, not about them ‘getting it right’. Designed in New Zealand Includes the two official languages of New Zealand - Māori and New Zealand Sign Language Features illustrations and a simple easy to follow description Board book so little hands can easily turn the pages Suitable for ages 6 months and up

The teddy texture is only on the outside with a warm and soft finish on the inside. Manufactured with love in the heart of Europe, Czech Republic. Traditionally crafted by people who cherish their work for decades. - Certified according to Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). GOTS is the worldwide leading textile processing standard for organic fibres, including ecological and social criteria, backed up by independent certification of the entire textile supply chain. - Certified by OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 at the Class 1 level, the most rigorous certification designed specifically for newborns through toddlers up to the age of three. In addition to testing for harmful chemicals at the strictest limit values, the test and verification methods also focus on pronounced resistance to saliva as an additional requirement for the Class 1 certification. We recommend a gentle wash before FIRST USE. The granny teddy tights are made from the softest organic cotton that gets stronger with every wash. *Important: It is important that your little one always wears the tights with braces in the correct way (as shown in all our pictures) - with one brace securely placed on the left shoulder and the other brace on the right shoulder in order to avoid abrasions. The braces help the little adventurers to freely move while playing and exploring the world and should be always used in the correct position. This is not a sleepwear product, remember to not leave your child unattended when wearing tights with braces.

- [KONGES SLODJ Gemma Swim Vest - Evening Sand](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/konges-slodj-gemma-swim-vest-evening-sand): Glitter float vest with tulle shoulder frills and sequin details. A float vest is the perfect swim accessory when your little ones are just beginning to splash around. It adds natural buoyancy and helps them get comfortable in the water while learning to swim on their own. Konges Slojd float vests are designed with inside foam sticks that can be adjusted according to the child’s skills and needs. The float sticks can easily be removed one by one as your child develops their swimming skills. Always remove the sticks in pairs starting with 1 & 1, then 2 & 2 and so on until your child is completely adapted to swimming by themselves. Once the child is secure and comfortable in the water, the buoyancy sticks can be removed all together. Designed with both zipper and velcro closure. Features a buckled safety crotch strap so that your child can never slip out of the vest. WARNINGS:This is not a lifesaving device. Only to be used in water in which the child is within its depth. WILL NOT PROTECT AGAINST DROWNING. USE ONLY UNDER CONSTANT SUPERVISION. NOT FOR USE IN BOATING

- [ORIA SKIN Gua Sha](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/gua-sha-bian-stone): Encourage blood circulation, relaxation massage, resulting with overall healthy, radiant, complexion. Our Obsidian Stone Gua Sha is a traditional Chinese medicine wisdom, this Gua Sha is more than a trending tool. Think beyond skin-deep and feel what is happening under your skin with lymphatic drainage, reduce inflammation and puffiness. A facial massage that promotes not only a revitalised appearance, but overall wellness. This Gua Sha is so lovely to handle, with a comb edge to work horizontally against deeper lines. You will love to pop this little one in your skincare bag to take everywhere you go! THE RITUAL Step 1: Cleanse your face Before using the Gua Sha, make sure your face is clean and free of makeup by cleansing using Gentle Milk Cleanser or Luminous Cleanse Oil. Step 2: Apply facial oil or serum Next, apply a few drops of our Luminous Cleanse oil or Rejuvenating Face Oil or your favourite serum to your skin. This will help the Gua Sha glide smoothly over your skin and prevent any friction or irritation. Step 3: Hold the Gua Sha at the right angle When using the Gua Sha tool, it's important to hold it at a 15-30 degree angle to your skin. This ensures that you're using the edge of the tool to apply gentle pressure to the skin, which can help stimulate circulation and promote lymphatic drainage. Be sure to use light pressure and avoid applying too much force, which can cause discomfort or irritation. Step 4: Start with the neck and décolletage Begin by using the curved edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along the contours of your neck and décolletage. Use upward strokes and light pressure, moving from the base of your neck up towards your chin and jawline. Step 5: Move on to the jawline and cheeks Next, use the flat side of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along your jawline and cheeks. Start at the center of your chin and move outward towards your ears, using light pressure and upward strokes. Repeat on the other side. Step 6: Use the small curves for the eye area For the delicate skin around your eyes, use the short edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape from the inner corner of your eye outwards. Be very gentle and use light pressure, avoiding the eye itself. Step 7: Use the U edge for the neck Run the U edge down the sides of the neck, and any other angled areas. Step 8: Move on to the forehead Finally, use the long edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along your forehead, starting at the center and moving outwards towards your hairline. Use light pressure and upward strokes. Step 9: Switch to the comb edge Flip the Gua Sha over and use the comb edge to gently massage your skin in a downward motion. This can help stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage, while also helping to distribute your facial products evenly across your skin. Step 10: Finish with a moisturiser or night cream After using the Gua Sha, apply more Oil or serum to your skin - alternatively finish with Balancing Day Cream Moisturiser or Overnight Firming Cream.

- [ORIA SKIN Vitamin C Renewal Serum](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/vitamin-c-renewal-serum): 100% Natural Brighten skin tone. Protect skin health.Bring balance. Crafted with skin brightening turmeric, the Vitamin C Renewal serum gives you results without the drama. Using a high concentration of Vitamin C boosted with plant extracts, this hormone-supporting formula fades scars, brightens & protects against damage. Renew & protect your glow, naturally. How this works: Protects your skin from damaging ageing free-radicals Hinders the body’s melanin production (the pigment that gives your skin colour). Less melanin means less pigmentation and fewer dark spots , leaving your skin brighter and more even. Vit C encourages your skin to get to work and produce more collagen. (the protein that plumps and firms) Provitamin B5 - maximises the moisture in your skin - by creating a moisture barrier shield. Stops dry, flaky and red skin. How to use Cleanse your face & apply Vitamin C Renewal Serum to clean skin morning & night. Follow it with an Oria Skin moisturiser or oil. Ingredients Aqua, Sodium Hyaluronate (inc benzyl alcohol & dehydroacetic acid) , Turmeric (Curcuma longa Root), Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract), Mamaku (Cyathea medullaris Leaf), Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate), Glycerine, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Provitamin B5, Geogard 221 & Citrus aurantium spp bergamia (Bergamot essential oil FCF free) Our Vitmain C ingredient is Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP), which is a derivative of Vitamin C. It's a stable, water-soluble form of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that is commonly used in skincare products due to its ability to deliver the benefits of Vitamin C without the instability issues that pure ascorbic acid often faces. Here are some key points about MAP: Stability: Unlike pure ascorbic acid, which can break down easily when exposed to air and light, MAP is much more stable, making it a popular choice for skincare formulations. Gentler on the Skin: It’s considered milder and less irritating compared to pure Vitamin C, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. Benefits: Like other forms of Vitamin C, MAP has antioxidant properties that help to brighten the skin, promote collagen production, and protect against environmental damage. Absorption: It still needs to be converted into ascorbic acid in the skin to be effective, but it’s a slower process, allowing for a more gradual release of Vitamin C benefits. So, MAP is essentially a more stable, skin-friendly form of Vitamin C used to achieve the same benefits without the drawbacks of traditional ascorbic acid.

- [SOLVEJ SWINGS Tree Hangers](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/tree-hangers): These tree hangers feature sturdy, wide straps designed to securely suspend your swing from the ideal tree branch. They are gentler on the tree compared to wrapping rope directly around the branch, and they also help protect your swing rope. To determine the right length, measure the branch’s circumference and add at least 30cm (12"). Additionally, these hangers can extend your swing ropes if your tree’s height exceeds the standard rope length.

- [FEATHER / DRUM](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/feather-drum-1): Feather Drum is a beautifully crafted and curated collection of future classics for women and girls. The philosophy centres on high-quality natural fabrics (organic or recycled wherever possible), modern, timeless shapes and well-made pieces that work hard in your wardrobe season after season. Sustainability and ethically made fashion is very important at Feather Drum. Created and patterned in Australia, the designs are thoughtful and considered, to ensure the fit and make-quality results in a collection of long-term investment pieces, lessening the environmental impacts associated with fast fashion. Feather Drum chooses to partner only with makers who carry the GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification and demonstrate socially sustainable practices, including provision of safe work conditions and fair wages. In the girls’ collection, look out for the “clothes that grow” label that signals the piece will grow with your child, extending its time in the wardrobe before being passed down – think adjustable waist bands and ties, styles that can be worn as dresses first and smock tops later and maxi lengths in skirts and dresses which can then turn to midi lengths as the years go by.

- [Pure Mama](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/pure-mama): PURE MAMA FOUNDER AND MAMA OF ONE - Lara Christie"When I fell pregnant I was really surprised by the lack of pregnancy-specific body products available, especially as our skin changes so much during this time and needs extra support.I wanted to create a product range that harnessed the powerful, natural ingredients often used in facial skincare, such as Pomegranate and Raspberry Seed Oil, and concentrated levels of Vitamin E, which are miracle workers for skin hydration, elasticity and repairing damage. We then married these with tried and trusted base blends of Coconut and Almond oils to create a new, more nourishing range of skincare for pregnant woman and nursing mothers."
