- [JENNA BROCKETT - First Signs](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/jenna-brockett-first-signs): Children understand hundreds of words and concepts before they can communicate verbally, and teaching basic signs to children benefits both them and their parents by providing a means of communication before and during speech development. â€œFirst Signsâ€ contains 13 New Zealand Sign Language signs with details and illustrations on how to do them to get you started. TheseÂ key signs will help you communicate with your little one, easing frustration [for everyone!] by giving them a means to express their wants and needs. You can begin introducing signs as early as you want, the earlier you do means more practice for you but studies show babies as young as six months old can remember and recognise a sign. By eight months some children are able to imitate gestures or communicate using simple one-word signs. Board Book 16 x 16 13 pages 6M+

The teddy warmy tights are made from the softest organic cotton that gets stronger with every wash.*Important:It is important that your little one always wears the tights with braces in the correct way (as shown in all our pictures) - with one brace securely placed on the left shoulder and the other brace on the right shoulder in order to avoid abrasions.The braces help the little adventurers to freely move while playing and exploring the world and should be always used in the correct position.This is not a sleepwear product, remember to not leave your child unattended when wearing tights with braces.

- [JENNA BROCKETT First Signs - Animals](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/jenna-brockett-first-signs-animals): Children understand hundreds of words and concepts before they cancommunicate verbally and teaching them signs gives you and your littleone a helping hand as they connect with the world around them, developinterests, and (most importantly) learn basic language skills. ‘First Signs - animals’ paves the way with some favourite animal signs asa fun extension or introduction to pre-verbal communication skills. You can begin introducing signs as early as you want, but studies show that babies as young as six months old can remember and recognise a sign. By eight months, some children are able to imitate gestures or communicate using simple one-word signs. Keep eye contact as you sign and say the word out loud, using the sign in direct context-sign dog when you see a dog in real life or in a book, and repeat the sign every time you see the animal. It’s very likely that your child will invent their own signs or usevariations of a sign you use. If they do, that’s fine. Keep using the ‘official’ sign and let them do their sign. Using sign language as a pre-verbal aid is all about the joy of communicating, not about them ‘getting it right’. Designed in New Zealand Includes the two official languages of New Zealand - Māori and New Zealand Sign Language Features illustrations and a simple easy to follow description Board book so little hands can easily turn the pages Suitable for ages 6 months and up

- [SILLY SILAS Granny Teddy Footless Tights - Peanut Blend](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/silly-silas-granny-teddy-footless-tights-steel-blue): Silly Silas Granny teddy tights with braces will keep your little ones comfy and cozy during winter adventures. The granny teddy tights are a tribute to the nostalgia of vintage fashion that once adorned our grandparents’ closets and the vibrant childhood memories we cherished with them. Crafted with a wide ribbed design in a snug teddy knit, supremely comfortable and wonderfully warm. Made from 78% organic cotton, 18% recycled polyamide and 4% elastane (LYCRA® fiber). The teddy texture is only on the outside with a warm and soft finish on the inside. Manufactured with love in the heart of Europe, Czech Republic. Traditionally crafted by people who cherish their work for decades. - Certified according to Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). GOTS is the worldwide leading textile processing standard for organic fibres, including ecological and social criteria, backed up by independent certification of the entire textile supply chain. - Certified by OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 at the Class 1 level, the most rigorous certification designed specifically for newborns through toddlers up to the age of three. In addition to testing for harmful chemicals at the strictest limit values, the test and verification methods also focus on pronounced resistance to saliva as an additional requirement for the Class 1 certification. We recommend a gentle wash before FIRST USE. The granny teddy tights are made from the softest organic cotton that gets stronger with every wash. *Important: It is important that your little one always wears the tights with braces in the correct way (as shown in all our pictures) - with one brace securely placed on the left shoulder and the other brace on the right shoulder in order to avoid abrasions. The braces help the little adventurers to freely move while playing and exploring the world and should be always used in the correct position. This is not a sleepwear product, remember to not leave your child unattended when wearing tights with braces.

- [KONGES SLODJ Gemma Swim Vest - Evening Sand](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/konges-slodj-gemma-swim-vest-evening-sand): Glitter float vest with tulle shoulder frills and sequin details. A float vest is the perfect swim accessory when your little ones are just beginning to splash around. It adds natural buoyancy and helps them get comfortable in the water while learning to swim on their own. Konges Slojd float vests are designed with inside foam sticks that can be adjusted according to the child’s skills and needs. The float sticks can easily be removed one by one as your child develops their swimming skills. Always remove the sticks in pairs starting with 1 & 1, then 2 & 2 and so on until your child is completely adapted to swimming by themselves. Once the child is secure and comfortable in the water, the buoyancy sticks can be removed all together. Designed with both zipper and velcro closure. Features a buckled safety crotch strap so that your child can never slip out of the vest. WARNINGS:This is not a lifesaving device. Only to be used in water in which the child is within its depth. WILL NOT PROTECT AGAINST DROWNING. USE ONLY UNDER CONSTANT SUPERVISION. NOT FOR USE IN BOATING

- [ORIA SKIN Gua Sha](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/gua-sha-bian-stone): Encourage blood circulation, relaxation massage, resulting with overall healthy, radiant, complexion. Our Obsidian Stone Gua Sha is a traditional Chinese medicine wisdom, this Gua Sha is more than a trending tool. Think beyond skin-deep and feel what is happening under your skin with lymphatic drainage, reduce inflammation and puffiness. A facial massage that promotes not only a revitalised appearance, but overall wellness. This Gua Sha is so lovely to handle, with a comb edge to work horizontally against deeper lines. You will love to pop this little one in your skincare bag to take everywhere you go! THE RITUAL Step 1: Cleanse your face Before using the Gua Sha, make sure your face is clean and free of makeup by cleansing using Gentle Milk Cleanser or Luminous Cleanse Oil. Step 2: Apply facial oil or serum Next, apply a few drops of our Luminous Cleanse oil or Rejuvenating Face Oil or your favourite serum to your skin. This will help the Gua Sha glide smoothly over your skin and prevent any friction or irritation. Step 3: Hold the Gua Sha at the right angle When using the Gua Sha tool, it's important to hold it at a 15-30 degree angle to your skin. This ensures that you're using the edge of the tool to apply gentle pressure to the skin, which can help stimulate circulation and promote lymphatic drainage. Be sure to use light pressure and avoid applying too much force, which can cause discomfort or irritation. Step 4: Start with the neck and décolletage Begin by using the curved edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along the contours of your neck and décolletage. Use upward strokes and light pressure, moving from the base of your neck up towards your chin and jawline. Step 5: Move on to the jawline and cheeks Next, use the flat side of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along your jawline and cheeks. Start at the center of your chin and move outward towards your ears, using light pressure and upward strokes. Repeat on the other side. Step 6: Use the small curves for the eye area For the delicate skin around your eyes, use the short edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape from the inner corner of your eye outwards. Be very gentle and use light pressure, avoiding the eye itself. Step 7: Use the U edge for the neck Run the U edge down the sides of the neck, and any other angled areas. Step 8: Move on to the forehead Finally, use the long edge of the Gua Sha to gently scrape along your forehead, starting at the center and moving outwards towards your hairline. Use light pressure and upward strokes. Step 9: Switch to the comb edge Flip the Gua Sha over and use the comb edge to gently massage your skin in a downward motion. This can help stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage, while also helping to distribute your facial products evenly across your skin. Step 10: Finish with a moisturiser or night cream After using the Gua Sha, apply more Oil or serum to your skin - alternatively finish with Balancing Day Cream Moisturiser or Overnight Firming Cream.

- [ORIA SKIN Vitamin C Renewal Serum](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/vitamin-c-renewal-serum): 100% Natural Brighten skin tone. Protect skin health.Bring balance. Crafted with skin brightening turmeric, the Vitamin C Renewal serum gives you results without the drama. Using a high concentration of Vitamin C boosted with plant extracts, this hormone-supporting formula fades scars, brightens & protects against damage. Renew & protect your glow, naturally. How this works: Protects your skin from damaging ageing free-radicals Hinders the body’s melanin production (the pigment that gives your skin colour). Less melanin means less pigmentation and fewer dark spots , leaving your skin brighter and more even. Vit C encourages your skin to get to work and produce more collagen. (the protein that plumps and firms) Provitamin B5 - maximises the moisture in your skin - by creating a moisture barrier shield. Stops dry, flaky and red skin. How to use Cleanse your face & apply Vitamin C Renewal Serum to clean skin morning & night. Follow it with an Oria Skin moisturiser or oil. Ingredients Aqua, Sodium Hyaluronate (inc benzyl alcohol & dehydroacetic acid) , Turmeric (Curcuma longa Root), Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract), Mamaku (Cyathea medullaris Leaf), Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate), Glycerine, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Provitamin B5, Geogard 221 & Citrus aurantium spp bergamia (Bergamot essential oil FCF free) Our Vitmain C ingredient is Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP), which is a derivative of Vitamin C. It's a stable, water-soluble form of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that is commonly used in skincare products due to its ability to deliver the benefits of Vitamin C without the instability issues that pure ascorbic acid often faces. Here are some key points about MAP: Stability: Unlike pure ascorbic acid, which can break down easily when exposed to air and light, MAP is much more stable, making it a popular choice for skincare formulations. Gentler on the Skin: It’s considered milder and less irritating compared to pure Vitamin C, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. Benefits: Like other forms of Vitamin C, MAP has antioxidant properties that help to brighten the skin, promote collagen production, and protect against environmental damage. Absorption: It still needs to be converted into ascorbic acid in the skin to be effective, but it’s a slower process, allowing for a more gradual release of Vitamin C benefits. So, MAP is essentially a more stable, skin-friendly form of Vitamin C used to achieve the same benefits without the drawbacks of traditional ascorbic acid.

Both, Banwood and Rispal, have brought their take of a modern design to the outside world, Rispal with its focus on the core of creating lighting designs from The Golden Age of French furniture and Banwood with establishing kid’s products in timeless designs and encouraging an active lifestyle. This collection is an homage of the 20th century French design to today’s children. The creation has been carefully done by the interior designer Douglas Mont and brought Banwood into the world of the House of Rispal. Douglas wanted to create a retro-design with elements from the 50s and 60s and a personal touch. The result is characterised by an extravagant design made of an exclusive selection of materials. The design of the frame is inspired by Streamline Moderne and characterised by curved structures and horizontal lines which represent the impression of movement and speed.The choice of wheels is based on Douglas personal connection to Clermont Ferrand, the city of Michelin, where he grew up. The Michelin tires give the bike the little extra personal touch and provide a secure ride.

The design of the frame is inspired by Streamline Moderne and characterised by curved structures and horizontal lines which represent the impression of movement and speed.The choice of wheels is based on Douglas personal connection to Clermont Ferrand, the city of Michelin, where he grew up.

- [SOLVEJ SWINGS Tree Hangers](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/products/tree-hangers): These tree hangers feature sturdy, wide straps designed to securely suspend your swing from the ideal tree branch. They are gentler on the tree compared to wrapping rope directly around the branch, and they also help protect your swing rope. To determine the right length, measure the branch’s circumference and add at least 30cm (12"). Additionally, these hangers can extend your swing ropes if your tree’s height exceeds the standard rope length.

- [MINImalisma](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/minimalisma): Minimalisma is a timeless brand with a Nordic heritage. Since 2011, minimalisma has crafted high-comfort garments from premium natural materials for little ones aged up to 6 years. We strive to create high-quality garments that not only look good, but also feel good – for a long time. Key to wearability and fabric selection is durability. All of our styles use materials that are stretchy and flexible, meaning that our garments can be enjoyed a little longer than average baby clothes. When choosing materials, we make no compromises: Only the best natural fabrics go into our clothing, such as silk, wool, cashmere, alpaca and organic cotton. Minimalisma is deeply rooted in Scandinavia.

- [Shirley Bredal](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/shirley-bredal): Shirley Bredal was established in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2006, by knit designer Shirley Bredal. The collection is now developed from Kathmandu itself. The collections are hand made with knits as our main focus and passion. The design is Scandinavian contemporary, with a hint of vintage. Each Shirley Bredal design is brought to life in the valley of Kathmandu, Nepal. They employ local people, some affected by disabilities, providing an income for themselves and their families according to fair trade principles. As Shirley Bredal products are individually hand crafted, slight variations may appear. We personally feel that it is these variations, that bring life and charm to each product.

- [FEATHER / DRUM](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/feather-drum-1): Feather Drum is a beautifully crafted and curated collection of future classics for women and girls. The philosophy centres on high-quality natural fabrics (organic or recycled wherever possible), modern, timeless shapes and well-made pieces that work hard in your wardrobe season after season. Sustainability and ethically made fashion is very important at Feather Drum. Created and patterned in Australia, the designs are thoughtful and considered, to ensure the fit and make-quality results in a collection of long-term investment pieces, lessening the environmental impacts associated with fast fashion. Feather Drum chooses to partner only with makers who carry the GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification and demonstrate socially sustainable practices, including provision of safe work conditions and fair wages. In the girls’ collection, look out for the “clothes that grow” label that signals the piece will grow with your child, extending its time in the wardrobe before being passed down – think adjustable waist bands and ties, styles that can be worn as dresses first and smock tops later and maxi lengths in skirts and dresses which can then turn to midi lengths as the years go by.

- [Pure Mama](https://www.littlebambinos.co.nz/collections/pure-mama): PURE MAMA FOUNDER AND MAMA OF ONE - Lara Christie"When I fell pregnant I was really surprised by the lack of pregnancy-specific body products available, especially as our skin changes so much during this time and needs extra support.I wanted to create a product range that harnessed the powerful, natural ingredients often used in facial skincare, such as Pomegranate and Raspberry Seed Oil, and concentrated levels of Vitamin E, which are miracle workers for skin hydration, elasticity and repairing damage. We then married these with tried and trusted base blends of Coconut and Almond oils to create a new, more nourishing range of skincare for pregnant woman and nursing mothers."
