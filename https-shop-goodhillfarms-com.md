- [San Martin De Pangoa, Peru 70% Dark Chocolate Bar](https://shop.goodhillfarms.com/products/san-martin-de-pangoa-peru-70-dark-chocolate-bar): Our San Martin de Pangoa, Peru 70% Dark Chocolate Bar is a sophisticated delight, made of native, organic cacao varietals grown for generations by family farmers in the Upper Amazon region of Peru.

For a deeper investigation into this Peruvian cacao flavor profile, try the companion bar for comparison and contrast -- our San Martin de Pangoa, Peru 85% Dark Chocolate Bar -- a surprisingly smooth and creamy dark chocolate with a very high cocoa content.Learn more!
