- [BOTATOX 100 UNITS](https://klumari.com/products/botatox-100-units): Product Description Active Ingredient: Clostridium botulinum toxin type AUnits: 100 UnitsIndications: Glabellar lines (frown lines)Excipients: Human serum albumin, Sodium chlorideComplex Size: Molecular weight of approximately 900 kDa Description A sterile, white lyophilized powder supplied in a transparent glass vial, which becomes a clear, colorless solution when reconstituted with sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride). Mechanism of Action The product works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction. This leads to temporary relaxation or paralysis of the targeted muscles in the injected area. When diluted to a safe concentration and injected precisely into facial muscles, the botulinum toxin reduces excessive muscle activity, resulting in the softening of wrinkles and fine lines. Dynamic facial wrinkles, such as deep frown lines, are caused by repetitive muscle contractions. By blocking the nerve signals that trigger these contractions, botulinum toxin treatment effectively smooths and relaxes facial wrinkles, restoring a more relaxed and youthful appearance.

- [KIARA REJU PDRN (3SYRINGE)](https://klumari.com/products/kiara-reju-pdrn-3syringe): Kiara Reju is a next-generation skin booster that combines the regenerative power of Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) with the deep hydration of non-cross-linked Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and the soothing, brightening effects of Niacinamide. This advanced formulation is designed to restore skin vitality, improve elasticity, and deliver a radiant, well-hydrated complexion. Each package contains three pre-filled syringes, each with a 2.2 ml volume, offering a comprehensive treatment option for both face and body. At the heart of Kiara Reju’s formulation is HA at 20 mg/ml, which delivers intense hydration by replenishing lost moisture in the skin. This is complemented by PDRN at 5 mg/ml, a powerful tissue regeneration agent that activates skin repair at the cellular level, improving elasticity and reducing visible signs of aging. In addition, Niacinamide at 1 mg/ml plays a crucial role in reducing inflammation, calming the skin after treatment, and enhancing skin tone and texture. Kiara Reju is ideal for treating various areas including the cheeks, temples, forehead, nose, neck, décolleté, and back of the hands. It is especially effective in minimizing fine lines, wrinkles, and improving overall skin quality. The results are often visible within just one week, with significant improvements in hydration, tone, elasticity, and barrier function. Depending on the treatment focus—whether hydration, superficial fine lines, or deep skin rejuvenation—different techniques and needle depths are recommended. For hydration, a 0.5 mm micro-needle using the MTS or nappage technique is ideal. For skin regeneration, 0.8 mm needles with papule technique are preferred. For deeper revitalization, such as targeting the lower dermal layers, 2 mm micro-needles with papule technique may be used. For safety, non-professionals are advised to use a 0.5 mm needle only. The recommended treatment course involves 3 to 5 sessions over a 3–4 week period. For long-term maintenance, treatments can be repeated every 6 to 9 months. When following the full protocol, results can last between 6 to 12 months, offering sustained improvements in skin texture and appearance. Kiara Reju is suitable for global use, with international shipping available. Each box includes three 2.2 ml syringes, making it a convenient and effective option for clinics and professional skincare providers looking to deliver visible, long-lasting skin rejuvenation.

- [MIRACLE-H](https://klumari.com/products/miracle-h): MIRACLE H is a next-generation skin booster developed to deliver intensive facial moisturization and overall rejuvenation. Combining the power of Polycaprolactone (PCL) and Hyaluronic Acid, this advanced formulation works at the molecular level to restore skin health, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve elasticity. PCL, a biodegradable polymer approved by the FDA, stimulates collagen production, helping to rebuild the skin’s structural integrity over time. Hyaluronic Acid, a naturally occurring substance known for its ability to bind and retain large amounts of water, delivers deep hydration, making the skin appear plumper, smoother, and more youthful. The synergistic action of these two key ingredients results in a comprehensive anti-aging effect—revitalizing tired, mature, or sun-damaged skin. MIRACLE H is particularly effective when applied to the face, neck, and the back of the hands, areas most commonly affected by aging and environmental damage. Its uniform, homogenous formula is free from large particles, allowing for smooth administration without leaving lumps or unevenness under the skin. Among its many benefits, MIRACLE H offers long-lasting rejuvenation, with results typically lasting six to twelve months post-treatment. The product supports collagen regeneration, reduces expression lines and aging-related wrinkles, and aids in the repair of post-acne scars and skin damage. It is also suitable for delicate areas such as the upper eyelid and fine lines around the eyes, delivering subtle yet visible improvements. MIRACLE H is indicated for individuals seeking effective solutions for mimic wrinkles, collagen depletion, dehydration, and signs of premature aging. The dual effect of hydration and regeneration not only improves the skin’s texture but also restores its overall vitality. Each package of MIRACLE H contains five 2ml vials, designed for use in professional clinical settings. Injections should only be administered by licensed cosmetologists or qualified medical professionals, as improper application can result in complications not covered by the manufacturer. Due to its formulation and method of action, MIRACLE H is not suitable for self-injection. With its advanced formula and clinically backed ingredients, MIRACLE H provides a safe, effective, and long-lasting solution for those looking to rejuvenate and deeply hydrate their skin while reversing visible signs of aging.

- [MIRACLE-L](https://klumari.com/products/miracle-l): MIRACLE L is an advanced PCL-based skin booster designed for facial lifting, deep regeneration, and comprehensive skin rejuvenation. Its key active ingredient is Polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polymer known for its ability to stimulate collagen production at the molecular level. Through this mechanism, MIRACLE L enhances skin elasticity, smooths out wrinkles of varying depths, and provides noticeable lifting and contouring effects across the face. Visible improvements begin to appear approximately one week after treatment, with results lasting up to 12 months. In addition to its lifting and anti-aging properties, MIRACLE L contributes to skin whitening, tone enhancement, and deep hydration, making it ideal for addressing damage caused by prolonged UV exposure or general age-related skin concerns. Its regenerative capabilities also make it suitable for preventive care, helping to delay early signs of aging by supporting the skin’s natural repair processes. MIRACLE L works by promoting stem cell proliferation within the skin, supporting continuous cellular renewal and repair. The sustained presence of PCL encourages long-term collagen synthesis, leading to firmer, more youthful-looking skin. This regenerative process not only targets wrinkles and sagging but also helps restore volume and improve overall skin quality. The formulation includes a carefully balanced blend of Polycaprolactone, Polyethyleneglycol, Water, Glycerin, Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate, and Sodium Pyroglutamic Acid. These components work together to deeply hydrate the skin, support structural integrity, and maintain a healthy skin barrier. MIRACLE L is administered via injection, using either a traditional syringe or an EZ injector, and is intended for use by licensed medical professionals. Treatment typically involves a series of sessions spaced over several weeks to achieve the most effective and lasting results. It is indicated for individuals seeking improvements in facial contouring, wrinkle reduction, skin texture enhancement, and hydration. The treatment offers multiple benefits: improved skin elasticity through ongoing collagen production, visible and long-lasting rejuvenation for up to one year, and a comprehensive improvement in overall skin appearance. With FDA-approved ingredients and a strong safety profile, MIRACLE L is a reliable solution for those looking to restore skin vitality, lift facial features, and reverse the effects of aging in a natural, gradual way.

- [PLAVANN VOLUME 200MG](https://klumari.com/products/plavann-volume-200mg): Pla’vann Volume 200mg is an advanced autologous tissue regenerative collagen stimulator that combines Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) and Hyaluronic Acid (HA), both naturally found in human skin tissue. This innovative injectable treatment is designed to activate the skin’s natural collagen production, offering a gradual yet long-lasting improvement in volume, firmness, and overall skin texture. Unlike traditional fillers that provide immediate but short-lived results, Pla’vann works over time to deliver more natural and sustained rejuvenation. PLLA is a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer that has been safely used in medical applications for over three decades. Once injected, it stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen, which helps restore skin elasticity and reduce signs of aging. As PLLA is broken down in the body, it produces harmless byproducts such as water, carbon dioxide, and glucose. The addition of Hyaluronic Acid further enhances the treatment by delivering immediate hydration, plumping the skin, and supporting the collagen-building process. As natural HA levels diminish with age, this inclusion helps to counteract dryness and volume loss, improving the skin's overall appearance. For treatment preparation, Pla’vann Volume should be mixed with 9cc of physiological saline and 1cc of lidocaine to ensure patient comfort during the procedure. The injection is administered into the subcutaneous layer using a 27G cannula for precise delivery. A series of three treatments, spaced one month apart, is recommended to achieve the best outcomes. Patients can expect improvements in skin volume, lifting, firmness, and a noticeable reduction in deep wrinkles. The effects of the treatment can last up to 24 months, making it a highly effective and long-lasting solution for those seeking natural skin rejuvenation without surgery.

It uniquely combines the immediate volumizing benefits of hyaluronic acid (HA) with the long-term collagen-inducing properties of polylactic acid (PDLLA), offering both instant and sustained results.

Application Guidelines: Route: Subcutaneous injection Technique: Depot method Needle Size: 25–26G Cannula Size: 22–25G Sessions: 2–3 treatments at 6–8 week intervals Thanks to advanced manufacturing technology, Arumi significantly reduces the risk of subcutaneous nodules often associated with traditional PLLA fillers.

- [LIPORASE](https://klumari.com/products/liporase): Liporase, also known as Hyaluronidase, is an enzyme-based solution specifically formulated to dissolve hyaluronic acid, commonly used in aesthetic medicine to correct or reverse the effects of HA-based dermal fillers. It is particularly effective in treating complications caused by overfilling, uneven distribution, incorrect placement, or accidental intravascular injection of fillers. The active ingredient, hyaluronidase, breaks down the bonds between hyaluronic acid molecules, enabling the body to absorb and eliminate the filler. Liporase is typically used when patients are dissatisfied with the results of filler injections and wish to reverse the procedure. It is capable of dissolving up to 90% of the injected filler within 48 hours, after which reapplication of filler is possible if needed. This product contains a white, freeze-dried powder supplied in 10 vials, each containing 1500 Units of hyaluronidase. To prepare the solution for use, the powder is typically mixed with 3ml of normal saline. Liporase is administered via injection into areas where HA filler was previously applied, and it can also be used in emergency situations such as accidental arterial injection to prevent tissue damage. Additionally, Liporase has applications in fat-reduction treatments and is sometimes combined with topical anesthetics to improve patient comfort during procedures. Hyaluronidase has a long-standing history of over 60 years in medical use and is also utilized off-label for treating foreign body reactions, filler-induced skin necrosis, and other complications. The enzymatic action starts immediately after injection, with full effects generally visible within 24 hours, though this may vary depending on individual patient responses. While Liporase is generally well-tolerated, some mild side effects such as redness, itching, swelling, or localized pain may occur at the injection site. More serious allergic reactions—including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, blurred vision, irregular heartbeat, or fever—require immediate medical attention. Liporase should be stored in unopened glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals, kept in a refrigerator at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C. It must not be frozen and should be protected from direct sunlight. Once reconstituted with saline, the solution can be stored below 30°C for up to two weeks but should not be used if it becomes discolored or develops precipitates. Liporase is contraindicated in individuals allergic to any of its components and should not be used to enhance the absorption of dopamine or other specific medications, nor to reduce swelling caused by insect bites. Its use in pregnant or breastfeeding women should only occur under medical supervision due to the lack of clinical safety data. This product is packaged in a box containing 10 vials and is manufactured in Korea. It is available for global shipping. Disclaimer: Bruno Dermal Filler products are intended strictly for use by licensed medical and aesthetic professionals and should not be administered by untrained individuals.

- [TAD® Glutathione 600mg/4ml Injections | Professional Skin Brightening & Detox IV Therapy](https://klumari.com/products/tad-gluthione-600mg-4ml): TAD® Glutathione 600mg/4ml – Professional Injectable Antioxidant for Clinics TAD® Glutathione 600mg/4ml is a high-purity, injectable formulation of reduced glutathione, the body's master antioxidant. Supplied as 100 lyophilized powder vials with 10 x 4ml solvent vials, this professional pack is designed for licensed medical and aesthetic practitioners to administer targeted antioxidant therapy, support detoxification protocols, and offer advanced skin-brightening treatments. Clinical Applications & Mechanism of Action:Glutathione is a tripeptide (cysteine, glycine, glutamine) critical for cellular defense. When administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), it bypasses digestion, ensuring rapid systemic bioavailability to: Neutralize Oxidative Stress: Scavenges free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting cells from damage. Enhance Detoxification: Supports Phase II liver conjugation pathways, facilitating the elimination of toxins and heavy metals. Promote Skin Brightening: Inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, reducing melanin production for a more even skin tone. Support Recovery & Performance: Reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress, potentially improving muscle recovery and reducing fatigue. The dosage and frequency of TAD 600mg administration can vary depending on the individual’s needs and health goals. For general detox purposes, 3 to 5 infusions over the course of 7 days are often recommended, with doses ranging from 1 g to 1.8 g per session. For skin-brightening purposes, a typical protocol may involve five infusions of 1200 mg over 10 days, often combined with 1 g of Vitamin C to enhance results. It is essential to consult with a medical professional before beginning treatment to determine the correct dosage and ensure suitability for the individual’s condition. While TAD 600mg is generally well-tolerated, some individuals may experience mild side effects such as nausea, headache, or stomach discomfort. Following proper medical guidance and adhering to dosage instructions is important to minimize risks and ensure safe use. Disclaimer: Bruno Dermal Filler products are strictly intended for use by licensed medical and aesthetic professionals. They are not suitable for self-administration or for use by individuals without proper training.
