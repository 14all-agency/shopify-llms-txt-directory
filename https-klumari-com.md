- [BOTATOX 100 UNITS](https://klumari.com/products/botatox-100-units): Product Description Active Ingredient: Clostridium botulinum toxin type AUnits: 100 UnitsIndications: Glabellar lines (frown lines)Excipients: Human serum albumin, Sodium chlorideComplex Size: Molecular weight of approximately 900 kDa Description A sterile, white lyophilized powder supplied in a transparent glass vial, which becomes a clear, colorless solution when reconstituted with sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride). Mechanism of Action The product works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction. This leads to temporary relaxation or paralysis of the targeted muscles in the injected area. When diluted to a safe concentration and injected precisely into facial muscles, the botulinum toxin reduces excessive muscle activity, resulting in the softening of wrinkles and fine lines. Dynamic facial wrinkles, such as deep frown lines, are caused by repetitive muscle contractions. By blocking the nerve signals that trigger these contractions, botulinum toxin  effectively smooths and relaxes facial wrinkles, restoring a more relaxed and youthful appearance.

- [LIPORASE](https://klumari.com/products/liporase): Liporase, also known as Hyaluronidase, is an enzyme-based solution specifically formulated to dissolve hyaluronic acid, commonly used in aesthetic  to correct or reverse the effects of HA-based dermal fillers. It is particularly effective in treating complications caused by overfilling, uneven distribution, incorrect placement, or accidental intravascular injection of fillers. The active ingredient, hyaluronidase, breaks down the bonds between hyaluronic acid molecules, enabling the body to absorb and eliminate the filler. Liporase is typically used when patients are dissatisfied with the results of filler injections and wish to reverse the procedure. It is capable of dissolving up to 90% of the injected filler within 48 hours, after which reapplication of filler is possible if needed. This product contains a white, freeze-dried powder supplied in 10 vials, each containing 1500 Units of hyaluronidase. To prepare the solution for use, the powder is typically mixed with 3ml of normal saline. Liporase is administered via injection into areas where HA filler was previously applied, and it can also be used in emergency situations such as accidental arterial injection to prevent tissue damage. Additionally, Liporase has applications in fat-reduction treatments and is sometimes combined with topical anesthetics to improve patient comfort during procedures. Hyaluronidase has a long-standing history of over 60 years in  use and is also utilized off-label for treating foreign body reactions, filler-induced skin necrosis, and other complications. The enzymatic action starts immediately after injection, with full effects generally visible within 24 hours, though this may vary depending on individual patient responses. While Liporase is generally well-tolerated, some mild side effects such as redness, itching, swelling, or localized pain may occur at the injection site. More serious allergic reactions—including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, blurred vision, irregular heartbeat, or fever—require immediate  attention. Liporase should be stored in unopened glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals, kept in a refrigerator at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C. It must not be frozen and should be protected from direct sunlight. Once reconstituted with saline, the solution can be stored below 30°C for up to two weeks but should not be used if it becomes discolored or develops precipitates. Liporase is contraindicated in individuals allergic to any of its components and should not be used to enhance the absorption of dopamine or other specific medications, nor to reduce swelling caused by insect bites. Its use in pregnant or breastfeeding women should only occur under  supervision due to the lack of clinical safety data. This product is packaged in a box containing 10 vials and is manufactured in Korea. It is available for global shipping. Disclaimer: Bruno Dermal Filler products are intended strictly for use by licensed  and aesthetic professionals and should not be administered by untrained individuals.

Promote Skin Brightening: Inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, reducing melanin production for a more even skin tone. Support Recovery & Performance: Reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress, potentially improving muscle recovery and reducing fatigue. The dosage and frequency of TAD 600mg administration can vary depending on the individual’s needs and health goals. For general detox purposes, 3 to 5 infusions over the course of 7 days are often recommended, with doses ranging from 1 g to 1.8 g per session. For skin-brightening purposes, a typical protocol may involve five infusions of 1200 mg over 10 days, often combined with 1 g of Vitamin C to enhance results. It is essential to consult with a  professional before beginning  to determine the correct dosage and ensure suitability for the individual’s condition. While TAD 600mg is generally well-tolerated, some individuals may experience mild side effects such as nausea, headache, or stomach discomfort. Following proper  guidance and adhering to dosage instructions is important to minimize risks and ensure safe use.

Pro TipUse the eye and mouth cutouts on areas like under-eyes, sides of the nose, or neck for targeted hydration. Important Notes Always perform a patch test if you have extremely sensitive skin or known allergies. Apply only to clean, toned skin to maximize absorption and effectiveness. This mask supports hydration and barrier care but does not replace daily essentials such as sunscreen or moisturizer. Follow the recommended wear time. Extended use beyond absorption may cause stickiness without improving results.
