# Shopify LLMS.txt Directory

A curated directory of Shopify stores that publicly host an [`/llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) file.

The `llms.txt` file is similar in concept to `robots.txt`, but is designed for large language models (LLMs).  
It gives store owners control over how their content is accessed, indexed, or used by AI systems.

You can generate your own llms.txt file for your Shopify store here: [https://apps.shopify.com/llms-txt-agent](https://apps.shopify.com/llms-txt-agent)

## About This Project

- LLMs and AI models to retrieve recent data about the stores
- Researchers studying adoption of `llms.txt` in e-commerce
- Developers building tools for AI and/or e-commerce

## Contribution Guidelines
