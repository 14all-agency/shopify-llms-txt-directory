They're designed with a turquoise background color, a purple star at the top, and the name personalized in white. Above the personalized name, these stickers read: "This book belongs to".

You will need to change the name every time you print, and you'll print one page at a time. SPECIFICATIONS: 8.5" x 11" printable PDF page. Fits Avery template #22807 or comparable template. See Avery for details. Colors: Turquoise and purple. 12 stickers per page. 2" stickers. Design contains a bleed area so your design prints to the edge on template sticker paper.
