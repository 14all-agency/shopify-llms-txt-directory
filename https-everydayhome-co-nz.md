- [ANA SANTL The Corner We Both Loved](https://everydayhome.co.nz/products/ana-santl-the-corner-we-both-loved): The photographs in The Summer Memories Collection are shot on analogue film. Compared to fast-paced digital photography, working with analog film gives moments of pause. There is a limit of exposures, that allows for only certain snapshots to be actually captured. The risk of technical imperfections becomes part of the story, Ana Santl explains. "I'm hoping that my work can serve as a mental holiday for those who decide to put them in their homes"

- [LISA WIRENFELT Meringue](https://everydayhome.co.nz/products/lisa-wirenfelt-meringue): Fine art print created by Lisa Wirenfelt exclusively for The Poster Club. Lisa's inspiration mainly comes from colour combinations and patterns that she experiences in her everyday life and in the world when travelling. However, her entire body of work showcases an act of contrasts: Balancing between skinny sketching with very few colours and broad, soft strokes in lots of bright colours. She explains: “I think it’s like eating wasabi between your sushi rolls. I need to cleanse from colour once in a while and then go back.”

- [SwiftDry SpinLine Rotary](https://everydayhome.co.nz/products/swiftdry-spinline-2-meter): The SwiftDry SpinLine Rotary Clothesline is the top of the line in Rotary Clotheslines, being a perfect fit for architectural homes, and a solid quality feel that you will appreciate everyday. We make the Spinline with heavy galvanised steel 3.6mm thick wall for the main pole, and the arms are made from 2mm thick wall galvinised steel. This is quite a statement when the industry standard for other rotary clotheslines is only 1mm steel wall on the main pole! We then Powder coat with Dulux Textura Black to finish, this gives it the elegant look that blends into and complements your home and outdoor landscape. The other very noticeable game changer with this model we designed here at SwiftDry, is that this is the only rotary clothesline available that does not have a tent pole like structure (or support arms) to hold the arms up, this is only possible because of the heavier duty steel use that can support itself. It does not have a winding handle hoist, instead it has 4 adjustable height positions 100mm apart, so you can set it to the height to suit you (around 100mm above head height is ideal) The lines are galvanised steel clothesline wire with 316 stainless steel turnbuckles (one for every line) that allow you to tension, or re-tension your lines at any stage without tools. It needs to be concreted into the ground, so it is not removable or foldable, so it is very strong and sturdy once installed It is available in 4 different diameters 2, 3, 4 or 5 meters overall. -Spinline 5 Meter = 64 meters of line space-Spinline 4 Meter = 40 meters of line space-Spinline 3 Meter = 22 meters of line space-Spinline 2 Meter = 11 meters of line space The best way to check what size you need is 1, How much washing do you have?2, Do you have limited space? Ideally you need at least 1 meter to spare around the edge of your SpinLine to allow it to spin freely without sheets and clothes getting caught on a bush/fence/shed close by. All SpinLines are Powder Coated Black, unless Custom Comes with our SwiftDry 30 year structural warranty, and free urban shipping NZ wide. Requires assembly on installation.
