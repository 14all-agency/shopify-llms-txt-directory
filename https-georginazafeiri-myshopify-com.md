- [Gosbeck sunset III, Suffolk](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/gosbeck-sunset-iii-suffolk): Gosbeck sunset, Suffolk. I have lived in a converted barn in Gosbeck for almost 5 months and have avidly and excitedly watched the changing colours of the sunset across the seasons. I'm also fascinated in the power and energy of the land, its ability to regenerate again and again through the seasons and years. Nature is far more powerful than human beings and we must remember this. This artwork explores my relationship with the land and how I am intrinsically bound with it. From obsessing about the colours in the sky to walking ancient routes as an artist and mountain leader. Acrylic paint, oil pastels, inks, cardboard, string, wool and photo transfer on canvas Artwork size 25 x 25cm Print size 20 x 20cm Created in 2025

I started off by ironing images of Felixstowe's colourful beach huts onto the canvas.

The string represents how I am intrinsically bound as an artist with the changing patterns of the earth and sky.

- [Southwold Serpent I](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/southwold-serpent-i): Southwold serpent I - this work is very experimental whereby I started off by ironing images of Southwold beach onto the canvas. Then I worked quickly using the energy that I feel from the waves into making the swirling marks and following it with string. I finally cover the canvas with watercolour inks and irridescent acrylic paints. The Southwold Serpent was sighted several times during 1938 by fishermen, a reverend and other tourists. It was claimed to be twice the length of the pier, with humps! Acrylic paint, oil pastels, inks, string, wool and photo transfer on canvas Artwork size 15 x 15cm Print size 15 x 15cm Created in 2025

- [Southwold Serpent II](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/southwold-serpent-ii): Southwold serpent II - this work is very experimental whereby I started off by ironing images of Southwold beach onto the canvas. Then I worked quickly using the energy that I feel from the waves into making the swirling marks and following it with string. I finally cover the canvas with watercolour inks and irridescent acrylic paints. The Southwold Serpent was sighted several times during 1938 by fishermen, a reverend and other tourists. It was claimed to be twice the length of the pier, with humps! Acrylic paint, oil pastels, inks, string, wool and photo transfer on canvas Artwork size 20 x 20cm Print size 20 x 20cm Created in 2025

- [Southwold seascape - sepia & ultramarine](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/southwold-seascape-sepia-ultramarine): Southwold seascape - sepia & ultramarine - I’ve always been a fan of Japanese prints, the colour blue and the sea. These are paintings of Southwold another of my favourite Suffolk coastal towns. I experimented with sepia ink too and wonder if the next step would be turquoise. They are both painted in Indian and acrylic watercolour inks. I love how they can be both translucent and opaque.

- [Gosbeck sunset, Suffolk](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/gosbeck-sunset-suffolk): Gosbeck sunset, Suffolk. I have lived in a converted barn in Gosbeck for almost 5 months and have avidly and excitedly watched the changing colours of the sunset across the seasons. I'm also fascinated in the power and energy of the land, its ability to regenerate again and again through the seasons and years. Nature is far more powerful than human beings and we must remember this. This artwork explores my relationship with the land and how I am intrinsically bound with it. From obsessing about the colours in the sky to walking ancient routes as an artist and mountain leader. Acrylic paint, oil pastels, inks, string, wool and photo transfer on canvas Artwork size 30 x 30cm Print size 20 x 20cm Created in 2025

- [Aldeburgh dreamtime](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/aldeburgh-dreamtime): Aldeburgh is one of my most favourite places in the UK. The town house many diverse components to a perfect day out; a beautiful clean shingle beach, classic Victorian architecture, uplifting contemporary art galleries and independant delis, shops and restaurants. I have shared both good and bad times with friends, boyfriends and family in here. Aldeburgh has a dream like quality for me when I visit and the light is always so bright no matter which season it is. I love the bracing winds as much as the sunny days and I am always excited to see what is going on in the community. In this painting I have experiemented with many new mediums. The first layer was created with photo tranfer, indian ink and oil pastels using images from New Years Eve 2024/5. The second layer was created with acrylic inks and acrylic paint applied in areas with a fork. The third layer was applied whist sitting on Aldeburgh beach in March 2025 and I explored using flourescent and irridescent acrylic paints with marker pen to create a dream like vision of the beach, its light and my memories. Acrylic paint, oil pastels, inks, marker pen and photo transfer on canvas Artwork size 60 x 43cm Print width: 30cm Created in 2025

- [What does love look like?](https://georginazafeiri.myshopify.com/products/what-does-love-look-like): What does love look like? graphite, ink & oil pastel on cartridge paper original artwork: 105 x 70cm 2023 Georgina has just finished her drawing called "What does love look like?" The drawing is about a visit that she made to Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts de Lausanne, Switzerland to see Lubaina Himid's exhibition So Many Dreams. Georgina really enjoyed a previous exhibition of Himid's at Serpentine gallery, London several years ago and was very please to see that Himid was exhibiting in Lausanne. Her drawing is a collage of photos and drawings that she made during her visit and includes drawings of the exhibition, the view out of the gallery window and sculptures in the main collection. Her artistic process involves drawing the things that resonated with her on the day and then collaging them together. The final image aims to give a sense of her experience through merging the drawings together as one. In doing so it also combines many different points of perspective and scale, for example the sculpture of arms was suspended in the air above her but seem more like a hoop to climb through. The architects' trees that were displayed in a case are now positioned in the drawing on the top of the sculpture of sticks. The sense of feeling trapped in the lower section of the drawing is notable and perhaps represents the artist's experience of living in the high mountains which can been seen in the upper section. The arms and hands linked together represent her need for friendship and community. This is a large scale drawing measuring 105 x 70cm and subtley nuances the artists' sketchbook, copying and enlarging smaller sketches. It is also created in oil pastel, indian ink and graphite bar to mimic the artist pose and movement of sketching with an open book whilst standing.
