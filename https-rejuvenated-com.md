Our award-winning collagen drinks contain hydrolysed marine collagen peptides. These are broken down into small molecules that are easily absorbed by the body. Once in the bloodstream, they help to stimulate the body’s own collagen production, supporting skin elasticity, hydration, and overall skin health from within.

Every ingredient we use is backed by published scientific studies or clinical trials for efficacy and safety. We also work with nutritionists and researchers to ensure each formula delivers results you can trust. Take a look at the results of our clinical trials.

Everyone is unique, but most people begin to notice benefits—such as improved skin hydration and suppleness—within 4–8 weeks of consistent daily use. Long-term use helps to maintain and enhance these results.

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that hydrolysed collagen peptides can improve skin elasticity, reduce fine lines, and support joint and connective tissue health. Our formulations use clinically studied doses to deliver these benefits.
