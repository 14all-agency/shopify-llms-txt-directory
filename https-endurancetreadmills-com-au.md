KEY FEATURES TO LOOK FOR HOME TREADMILLS When looking for a home treadmill, it's important to consider several key features including manual treadmills, and running to ensure that you choose a model that is suitable for your needs. One of the most critical features to consider when purchasing treadmills for your own personal home gym is the powertrain, as you'll want a treadmill with a motor that is powerful enough to support your weight and your desired workout intensity in your home fitness space. When selecting a treadmill, it's important to consider the features that will best suit your home fitness space and training needs. Look for treadmills with a variety of speed settings and adjustable incline options to challenge yourself during your workout. A clear screen display is also crucial for tracking your progress and staying motivated. Additionally, safety features such as an emergency stop button and sturdy handrails can help prevent accidents while using a treadmill. Finally, consider the noise level of the treadmills, particularly if you plan to use it for running or training in a shared living space. By taking these key features into account, you can select an electric treadmill that meets your fitness goals and provides a safe, comfortable, and effective workout experience. Key features to consider: ✔ Motor: The motor is the heart of the treadmill and is responsible for powering the running belt. When selecting a treadmill, make sure that the motor is powerful enough to support your weight and the desired workout intensity. A motor with a higher horsepower (HP) rating will be able to handle more weight and provide a smoother and quieter workout experience. ✔ Running Surface: The size of the running surface is an important factor to consider, especially if you have long legs or if you plan to do sprints or intervals. A larger running surface will give you more room to move and make your workout more comfortable. Additionally, when looking for a good treadmill, make sure that the running belt is made of high-quality materials that can withstand the wear and tear of regular use. If you have limited space, consider a compact or folding treadmill that can fit in smaller areas. However, if you prefer a standard treadmill, ensure it meets your requirements for size and features. ✔ Incline: Many treadmills offer adjustable incline settings, which can help you increase the intensity of your workout. Incline settings can simulate hills or stairs, making your workout more challenging and engaging. Look for a treadmill with a range of incline options to add variety to your workout routine. ✔ Speed: The speed of the treadmill is another important consideration. Make sure that the treadmill can reach the speeds you need for your workout. Some treadmills offer speeds up to 12 miles per hour or more, which is ideal for running workouts. Others may have lower maximum speeds, which may be suitable for walking or jogging. ✔ Display: The display is an essential component of the treadmill as it shows your workout metrics such as speed, time, distance, and calories burned. Look for a clear and easy-to-read display that is user-friendly and provides the information you need to track your progress. ✔ Safety Features: Safety features are crucial when it comes to choosing a home treadmill. Make sure that the treadmill has an emergency stop button, a sturdy handrail, and other safety features that can protect you from accidents or injuries. ✔ Noise: Consider the noise level of the treadmill, especially if you plan to use it in a shared living space. Some treadmills are quieter than others, and you may want to opt for a model with noise-reducing features if you are concerned about disturbing others. Best Home Treadmills for Running and Incline Training Home treadmills are not just for casual walking or light jogging, they can also be used for running and incline training. With a powerful motor and wide delivery, the deck is capable of handling intense workouts. The powertrain ensures smooth operation, making it easy to adjust the incline to your desired level. Running on treadmills is a low-impact way to get a high-intensity cardiovascular workout at home gym that is less stressful on the joints compared to running outdoors.

Many home treadmills are equipped with features that are specifically designed for running and training, such as larger decks, higher speed, powertrain, and more cushioned surfaces with wide delivery.

- [Incline Treadmills: Enhancing Your Workout Routine with Elevated Intensity](https://endurancetreadmills.com.au/collections/incline-treadmills): Incline treadmills are a type of treadmill that allows users to adjust the incline levels and positions of the machine. These treadmills come in various designs such as foldable, electric, and automatic incline, making them suitable for different needs and preferences. With incline treadmills, users can experience a more challenging workout compared to standard treadmills as they simulate uphill running or walking. Adjustable Incline Levels One of the main features of an incline treadmill is its adjustable inclination levels. Users can increase or decrease the angle of the treadmill deck to mimic hill running or walking. The best incline on treadmills depends on individual fitness goals and physical capabilities. However, most experts recommend starting with a 1-2% grade for beginners and gradually increasing it up to 5-15% for advanced users. Different Types of Incline Treadmills There are several types of incline treadmills available in the market today. Foldable design makes it easy to store when not in use while electric models allow you to adjust the speed at your convenience. Automatic incline models offer preset programs that automatically adjust speed and inclination levels based on your fitness goals. Safety Tips When Using Incline Treadmills To ensure safety while using an incline treadmill, it is recommended to use standard size treadmill mats which help reduce noise levels while also protecting your floors from scratches or damage caused by heavy equipment like bench press machines when used on an inclined surface. Are Incline Treadmills Worth It? Incline treadmills are definitely worth it for those who want to challenge themselves and take their workout routine to the next level. They offer a more intense workout compared to standard treadmills, which can help burn more calories and improve cardiovascular health. However, it is important to consider your fitness goals, physical capabilities, and budget before investing in an incline treadmill. Differences Between Incline Treadmills and Regular Treadmills Steeper Incline for Intense Workouts Incline treadmills have a steeper maximum incline than regular treadmills, allowing for a more intense workout and greater calorie burn. While regular treadmills typically have an incline range of 0-15%, incline treadmills can go up to 40% or even higher. This steep incline makes it possible to target specific muscle groups in the legs, such as the glutes and hamstrings, while also providing a cardiovascular challenge. The steeper incline on an incline treadmill also means that users can burn more calories in less time compared to a regular treadmill. According to a study by the American Council on Exercise (ACE), running on an incline treadmill at a 10% grade burns about 50% more calories than running on a flat surface. This increased calorie burn can be especially beneficial for those looking to lose weight or improve their overall fitness level. Additional Features for Incline Training Incline treadmills often come with additional features such as heart rate monitors and pre-programmed workouts specifically designed for incline training. These features can help users track their progress and ensure that they are getting the most out of their workouts. Heart rate monitors allow users to monitor their heart rate during exercise, which is important for ensuring that they are working at an appropriate intensity level. Many incline treadmills also come with pre-programmed workouts that automatically adjust the speed and incline based on specific goals, such as fat burning or hill training. Less Expensive Option Regular treadmills are typically less expensive than incline treadmills, making them a more budget-friendly option for those not looking for the added challenge of incline training. While regular treadmills may not provide the same level of intensity as an incline treadmill, they still offer many benefits when it comes to cardiovascular fitness. Regular treadmills are a great option for those looking to improve their overall fitness level or maintain their current level of fitness. They are also a good choice for those who may be recovering from an injury or need a low-impact workout. Benefits of Using an Incline Treadmill for Walking and Running Natural Running Experience Simulating outdoor terrain, incline treadmills provide a more natural running experience. This helps improve balance, stability, and overall form. The incline feature allows users to target specific muscle groups in their legs while walking or running. As the incline increases, the user engages more muscles in their lower body such as glutes, hamstrings, and calves. Incline treadmills also help reduce the risk of injury by promoting proper form and reducing joint impact. By engaging different muscle groups in the legs, it also helps prevent overuse injuries that can occur from repetitive motion on flat surfaces. Therapeutic Benefits Using an incline treadmill can have therapeutic benefits for individuals with injuries or chronic pain. The low-impact workout provided by an incline treadmill reduces stress on joints and minimizes the risk of further injury. A study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy found that walking on an incline treadmill significantly reduced knee pain for individuals with osteoarthritis compared to walking on a flat surface. Walking on an incline can improve cardiovascular health without putting excessive strain on joints. Mental Health Benefits The benefits of using an incline treadmill extend beyond just physical health. Studies have shown that exercising on an incline can also improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety levels. Incline workouts increase endorphins which are known to boost mood levels. A study published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology found that participants who exercised at a 10% incline experienced less stress than those who exercised at a 0% incline. The same study also found that participants who exercised at a higher intensity had lower levels of anxiety compared to those who exercised at a lower intensity. Versatile Workout Option Incline treadmills offer a versatile workout option for users as they allow for adjustments in both speed and incline level. Users can create customized workouts that target specific muscle groups and increase cardiovascular endurance. Incline training is also beneficial for athletes who want to improve their performance in sports such as running, hiking, or skiing. Incline treadmills are also ideal for individuals who want to burn more calories during their workout. The incline feature increases the intensity of the workout, leading to a higher calorie burn compared to walking or running on a flat surface. Burn More Calories with an Incline Treadmill Increase the Intensity of Your Workout with an Incline Treadmill Toned Body One of the most significant benefits of incline treadmills is that they can help you achieve a toned body. By increasing the intensity of your workout, you can burn more calories, which can lead to weight loss and muscle toning. Walking or running on an incline treadmill engages more muscles in your legs, hips, and core than walking or running on a flat surface. This increased engagement leads to greater calorie burn and muscle activation. Weight Loss Incline treadmills are also effective for weight loss because they allow you to burn up to 50% more calories than walking or running on a flat surface. Spending just 30 minutes on an incline treadmill can burn as many calories as running for several hours on a flat surface. This means that even if you don't have much time to work out, you can still get an effective calorie-burning workout by using an incline treadmill. Target Different Muscle Groups The incline feature on a treadmill allows you to target different muscle groups in your legs, helping to tone and strengthen them. Walking or running at different inclines targets different muscles in your lower body, including your glutes, hamstrings, calves, and quadriceps. By targeting these muscles through exercise, you can achieve a more toned and defined lower body. Incorporating Incline Treadmills into Your Workouts If you're new to using an incline treadmill, it's essential to start slowly and gradually increase the incline over time. Begin by walking at a low incline for five minutes before gradually increasing the grade until you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. As your fitness level improves, increase the duration and intensity of your workouts by adding intervals of higher inclines. Increase Endurance and Strengthen Leg Muscles with an Incline Treadmill Intensive Cardio Exercises Incline treadmills offer a challenging workout that can help you achieve your fitness goals faster. Unlike traditional treadmills, incline treadmills allow you to adjust the angle of the running surface, allowing you to simulate uphill running and target different muscle groups. This means that with an incline treadmill, you can get a more intensive cardio exercise than with a regular treadmill. Indoor Workouts One of the biggest advantages of using an incline treadmill is that it allows you to perform indoor workouts that provide efficient motor and cardiovascular workouts. This is especially important during bad weather or when you're short on time. With an incline treadmill, you can get a full-body workout without leaving your home. Cardio Training Cardio training is essential for anyone who wants to improve their overall health and fitness levels. With an incline treadmill, you can target your leg muscles while performing cardio exercises. Leg extensions are one of the most effective exercises for strengthening your leg muscles, and they are easy to perform on an incline treadmill. Training Programs Incline treadmills are ideal for training programs that require strength and endurance, such as running 6km or more. By incorporating an incline into your workout routine, you can increase the intensity of your training program and challenge yourself in new ways. This will help you build both strength and endurance over time. Multiple Muscle Groups With an incline treadmill, you can incorporate bicep curls, decline bench press, and other exercises to work on multiple muscle groups simultaneously. This makes it easier to achieve your fitness goals by providing a challenging workout that targets multiple areas of your body at once. Efficient Motor WorkoutsEfficient motor workouts are essential for building strength and improving overall fitness levels. Incline treadmills provide efficient motor workouts by allowing you to adjust the angle of the running surface. This means that even if you only have a short amount of time to work out, you can still get a challenging and effective workout. Target Your Leg Muscles Incline treadmills are particularly effective at targeting your leg muscles. By simulating uphill running, incline treadmills engage your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves in ways that traditional treadmills cannot. This makes them an excellent choice for anyone who wants to strengthen their leg muscles and improve their overall fitness levels. Fitness Goals Ultimately, using an incline treadmill can help you achieve your fitness goals by providing a challenging workout that targets your leg muscles and improves your overall strength. Whether you're training for a race or just trying to stay in shape, an incline treadmill is an excellent tool for achieving your goals. So why not try one out today? Reduce Impact on Joints with an Incline Treadmill Shock Absorbers and Cushioning System for Reduced Joint Impact Incline treadmills are the perfect solution for those who want to work out without putting too much stress on their joints. The shock absorbers and shockcontrol cushioning system of these treadmills are designed to reduce impact on joints during use, making them a great choice for people with joint problems or injuries. These features also make it possible to reach speeds that would otherwise be impossible on regular treadmills. The height adjustment feature of incline treadmills allows users to simulate natural terrain, which makes workouts more challenging and effective. This feature is particularly useful for runners who want to train for outdoor races, as it helps them prepare for different terrains they may encounter during the race. This feature can help prevent boredom during workouts by adding variety and new challenges. Easy Mobility and User-Friendly Controls Incline treadmills are designed with easy mobility in mind. They come equipped with smooth wheels that make it easy to move the treadmill around, saving work hours in setting up a workout space. This feature is especially useful if you have limited space in your home gym or if you like to switch things up frequently. The user-friendly controls of incline treadmills make them easy to use and comfortable for extended periods of time. The composite running board provides thick padding that reduces impact on your feet, while the lubrication system ensures smooth operation even at high speeds. Compact Storage Spaces Incline treadmills are also designed with compact storage spaces in mind. When not in use, they can be easily folded up and stored away in a closet or under a bed, leaving ample space for dumbbell arm curls or mobile device use. This makes them an ideal choice for those who live in small apartments or have limited space in their homes.

Tips for Setting Up Your Incline Treadmill for Maximum Results Set Your Incline Treadmill at an Appropriate Level to Achieve Your Daily Fitness Goals The incline feature on a treadmill can be incredibly beneficial for those looking to achieve their daily fitness goals. It allows you to increase the intensity of your workout by simulating uphill running or walking, which engages more muscles and burns more calories. However, it is important to set your incline at an appropriate level based on your fitness level and goals. For beginners, it is recommended to start with a low incline of around 1-2%. This will still provide some added resistance without putting too much strain on your joints and muscles. As you progress in your fitness journey, you can gradually increase the incline level to challenge yourself and continue seeing results. Adjust the Speed of Your Incline Treadmill to Match Your Maximum Speed for Optimal Results In addition to adjusting the incline level, it is important to also adjust the speed of your treadmill. To get optimal results from your workout, you should aim to match your maximum speed with the appropriate incline level. This will help you burn more calories and improve cardiovascular endurance. If you are unsure what speed to set your treadmill at, start with a moderate pace that allows you to maintain proper form and breathing. From there, gradually increase the speed until you reach a comfortable but challenging pace. Make Further Adjustments to the Incline and Speed as You Progress in Your Fitness Journey As mentioned earlier, it is important to make adjustments as you progress in your fitness journey. This includes increasing both the incline level and speed of your treadmill over time. By doing so, you will continue challenging yourself and seeing improvements in both strength and endurance. However, it is important not to push yourself too hard too quickly. Gradual increases are key in avoiding injury or burnout. Always listen to your body and adjust accordingly. Organize Cable Management To Avoid Tripping Hazards and Ensure Safety During Workouts One often overlooked aspect of setting up an incline treadmill is cable management. It is important to organize the cords and wires to avoid tripping hazards and ensure your safety during workouts. Make sure all cables are properly secured and tucked away, so they do not interfere with your movements. This will also help prolong the lifespan of your equipment by preventing damage to the cords. Always Consult With a Professional Trainer or Physician Before Starting Any New Exercise Routine Lastly, it is crucial to consult with a professional trainer or physician before starting any new exercise routine. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your fitness level, goals, and any pre-existing  conditions. They can help you develop a safe and effective workout plan that incorporates the use of an incline treadmill for maximum results. Why an Incline Treadmill is a Smart  for Your Health Investing in an incline treadmill is a smart move for your health. Not only does it offer a variety of benefits, but it also provides a convenient way to exercise from the comfort of your own home. With its ability to increase endurance, burn more calories, and reduce impact on joints, an incline treadmill is a valuable addition to any fitness routine. Using an incline treadmill for walking or running allows you to target different muscle groups and challenge yourself in new ways. By increasing the incline, you can engage your glutes, hamstrings, and calves more effectively than on a regular treadmill. This added resistance can help improve overall leg strength and endurance. In addition to strengthening muscles, using an incline treadmill can also help you burn more calories during your workout. By increasing the intensity of your exercise with the incline feature, you can elevate your heart rate and boost your metabolism. This means that even if you're short on time, incorporating an incline into your workout can help you get the most out of each session. Perhaps one of the biggest advantages of using an incline treadmill is its ability to reduce impact on joints. Running on hard surfaces like concrete or pavement can put stress on knees and ankles over time. In contrast, using an incline treadmill allows you to exercise without putting as much pressure on these areas. This makes it a great option for those who are recovering from injuries or looking for low-impact exercises. When shopping for an incline treadmill, be sure to consider factors such as price range, features offered (such as built-in programs), and customer reviews before making a purchase decision. Whether you choose to buy online or in-store, take advantage of comparison shopping tools that allow you to compare prices across multiple retailers. Setting up your new incline treadmill properly is key to getting maximum results from each workout session. Be sure to follow manufacturer instructions carefully when assembling the machine and adjusting settings. Consider consulting with a personal trainer or fitness expert to create a workout plan that incorporates your new incline treadmill. Read more

- [The best treadmill in Australia 2025: Our top pick of the year](https://endurancetreadmills.com.au/collections/the-best-treadmill-in-australia-2025-our-top-pick-of-the-year): If you want a space saving treadmill that's easy to use and doesn't skimp on features, the Endurance SPT is our #1 choice for 2025. The Endurance SPT has been named the best overall treadmill in Finder's 2024 Best Treadmill Guide, beating out more than 20 other brands. Our shopping experts chose this model due to its space-saving design, ease-of-use, customer testimonials and overall bang for buck. Here are a few product features that our reviewers were particularly impressed by: Compact design: The Endurance SPT's space-saving design is impressive for a medium-size treadmill, measuring just 91cm x 71cm x 145cm when folded. This makes it particularly well suited to people living in smaller spaces. Easy set up: With a hydraulic lift and wheeled base, it's a cinch to pack up and move around, even for older users. It also comes fully assembled - simply unfold the treadmill and add the 6 included bolts. Lifetime motor warranty: Beneath the hood, the Endurance SPT boasts a 2.5CHP motor that comes with a lifetime warranty. 2.5CHP provides a good balance between power and noise levels. The speed maxes out at 20km per hour which should be more than enough for most users. Easy on joints: The SPT features a cushion suspension system in the centre of the deck. This simple piece of engineering significantly reduces the impact on your joints during workouts. Good belt width: Measuring 125cm long and 46cm wide, the SPT treadmill belt provides enough real estate for full-speed running for people of average height. Uphill running: The SPT is equipped with a 20-level automatic incline system. This allows users to fine-tune workouts to match their personal fitness goals, including steep uphill challenges. Large LCD: The blue-tinted LCD is one of the biggest we've seen from a treadmill in this price range. It tracks the speed, incline, elapsed time, distance, calories burned and heart rate so you can monitor progress throughout the workout. Safe stopping feature: When you're done with your workout, the treadmill belt gradually slows down instead of stopping dead. This feels more natural and is a lot safer. All in all, the Endurance SPT Treadmill provides the perfect blend of a space-saving design, robust performance and thoughtful attention to your joint health. Looking beyond our reviews team, the Endurance SPT has an impressive average customer score of 4.8 out of 5 stars across Amazon, Home Gym Equipment Australia and Google Reviews.

Putting the treadmill together was a breeze with no issues at all and up and running withing a few minutes. Very convenient to use throughout the day underneath my computer while working at home. Treadmill is very quiet and well put together. Only downside was the delivery experience as it wasn't ideal as the drive only called when he was parked outside the house to see if I was home. Luckily, I happen to be at home at that point so it wasn't a big problem. The Endurance Treadmill has exceeded all my expectations. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 05/06/2024 A.R.

Very thoughtful design. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 04/16/2024 Leanne Limacher (Sydney, AU) Whisper quiet sturdy machineI have been using my Endurance Athlete treadmill for just over a week now and have to say that I am impressed.The electronic control panel is easy to use and the only noise I hear when it's running is the sound of my shoes.It fits perfectly into the space in front of our second TV so I have been binge-watching movies while I exercise which makes the time fly by.I would definitely recommend this treadmill and would absolutely buy from Endurance again. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 12/17/2023 Christine_Y (Sydney, AU) Love the treadmillI've been using the treadmill almost every day since I received it. I hadn't been on the treadmill ever since I moved out of my apartment about 9 years ago. I missed doing exercise and always wanted to get one. I can use it anytime I want when I'm at home. The only downsides are a bit too heavy to move around and the incline has 15 levels, but it's not quite steep enough for me.

Know your running needs: Consider factors such as speed range, workout programs, and user weight capacity to match the treadmill to your fitness goals. Consider space and setup: Measure your available space, assess folding options, and plan for electrical outlets to accommodate the treadmill in your home. Manage budget wisely: Compare prices, explore financing options, and look for sales or second-hand treadmills to find a suitable option within your budget. Prioritise safety and comfort: Focus on safety features like emergency stop buttons and handrails, and choose a treadmill with adequate cushioning to prevent injuries and enhance comfort during runs. Regular maintenance is key: Keep the treadmill clean, lubricate moving parts as recommended, and perform routine checks to ensure optimal performance and longevity. Key Features to Evaluate Motor Power Assess motor power to determine the treadmill's speed and incline capabilities. A higher horsepower ensures smoother transitions between different speeds and inclines, crucial for runners aiming to push their limits. Running Surface Size Examine the running surface size to ensure comfort and stability during workouts. A wider and longer running surface provides ample space for natural strides, reducing the risk of accidents or discomfort during intense sessions. Additional Features Check for additional features such as heart rate monitors and built-in workouts. Heart rate monitors help runners track their cardiovascular performance, while built-in workouts offer varied training options to keep motivation high and fitness goals on track. Understanding Your Running Needs Identify Goals When considering a treadmill for runners, start by identifying your running goals. Whether it's weight loss, improving endurance, or training for races, knowing your objectives is crucial. This will help you select a treadmill with the right features to support your fitness journey. Determine Running Style Your preferred running style, including pace and distance, plays a significant role in choosing the right treadmill. If you enjoy high-intensity interval training (HIIT), look for a treadmill with treadmill workout programs that cater to interval training. For long-distance runners, a treadmill with shock absorption features can reduce impact on joints. Consider Health Issues Before purchasing a treadmill, consider any specific health issues that may impact your choice. For instance, if you have joint problems, opt for a treadmill with cushioning technology to reduce strain on your joints. It's essential to choose a treadmill that aligns with your health needs to ensure a safe and effective workout experience. Space and Setup Considerations Measure Space When setting up a treadmill for runners, measure available workout space to ensure it comfortably accommodates the equipment. This step is crucial to prevent any constraints during your running sessions. Portability and Storage Evaluate the need for portability or folding options when considering the treadmill's placement.

Power Outlets and Ventilation Consider the proximity to power outlets and ventilation when finalizing the setup. Placing the treadmill near a power source ensures easy access, while adequate ventilation prevents overheating during intense workouts. Budget and Payment Options Financing Options Consider payment plans or financing to afford higher-end treadmills, spreading the cost over time. Warranty and Maintenance Review warranties for repair coverage and maintenance costs to factor into your long-term budget planning. Setting a Budget Establish a clear budget range before exploring treadmill options to streamline your decision-making process. Comparison Shopping Compare prices across different brands and models, looking for sales or discounts to maximise your purchasing power. Gym Membership Savings Calculate potential savings from cancelling a gym membership, as investing in a treadmill can be a cost-effective  in the long run. Safety and Comfort Tips Prioritise Safety Features When buying a treadmill for runners, prioritise models with safety features such as emergency stop buttons. These features are crucial in ensuring the safety of the user during intense workouts. Gradual Adjustment Adjust the settings of the treadmill gradually to prevent injuries while running. Sudden changes in speed or incline can strain muscles and lead to accidents. Gradual adjustment helps in easing the body into different workout intensities. Proper Footwear and Clothing Ensure you wear proper footwear and clothing when using a treadmill. Proper footwear provides necessary support and cushioning, reducing the risk of impact-related injuries. Comfortable clothing allows for unrestricted movement and enhances the overall running experience.
