- [The Lost Passage Collection | 4-Scent Wax Melt Set - Sunset Haven Scent Co.](https://sunsethavenscentco.myshopify.com/products/book-lover-wax-melts-cozy-literary-home-fragrance): The Lost Passage Collection is a quiet journey into the unknown — inspired by forgotten maps, lantern-lit decks, and the moments between departure and return. Each scent is crafted to feel like a page from an untold story. Not loud. Not rushed. Just atmosphere. Warm woods, softened spice, coastal air, and gentle sweetness come together to create wax melts meant for slow evenings, thoughtful spaces, and imagined horizons. These fragrances aren’t about where you’ve been — they’re about where you’re willing to go. A reminder that some paths are meant to be felt, not followed. Poured in small batches and packaged in our signature plastic-free style, this collection is designed for those who love scent with depth, mood, and meaning. 1, The Captain’s Watch A captivating, atmospheric fragrance built around warm amber and earthy oakmoss, softened by fresh sage and layered with subtle citrus and floral depth. Notes of orange zest and grapefruit cut through the air like the first light over open water, while tonka bean, lavender, and rose musk settle into a smooth, grounded finish. The result is dark, steady, and quietly commanding — a scent that feels like standing watch on a silent deck, eyes fixed on a horizon that keeps its secrets. 2, Under Starless Skies A deep, complex fragrance that opens with bright bergamot and lemon-lime, cutting through the air like wind across open water, softened by delicate rose bud and a quiet touch of grapefruit. At the heart, warm cardamom unfolds alongside melon and jasmine, adding depth and a sense of drifting intrigue. The scent settles into a rich base of exotic amber, smooth vanilla, and sandalwood, creating a grounded, steady finish that feels hushed, confident, and endless — like navigating the sea with no stars above and only instinct to guide the way. 3, Lantern at the Edge A rich, inviting fragrance that opens with luscious black currant and warm saffron, glowing softly like lantern light against the dark. Juicy blackberry and smooth vanilla emerge at the heart, adding depth and a restrained sweetness that feels comforting but never simple. The scent settles into a dark, velvety base of amber, anise, and musk, creating a warm, lingering finish that feels intimate and watchful — a quiet moment of light before the unknown begins. 4, Where the Map Ends A balanced, refreshing fragrance that opens with cool fresh mint and peppermint, cutting clean through the air like a steady wind at sea, softened by smooth vanilla. Earthy patchouli and crisp green notes emerge beneath the surface, grounded by warm woods and soft musk. The result is clean yet quietly resolute — a calming, focused scent that feels like the moment you step beyond the charted path, guided by instinct rather than direction. - Sunset Haven Scent Co.

- [What the Woods Remember
A Cabin-Inspired Wax Melt Collection - Sunset Haven Scent Co.](https://sunsethavenscentco.myshopify.com/products/cabin-coast-wax-melts-rustic-outdoor-home-fragrance): What the Woods Remember A Cabin-Inspired Wax Melt Collection Some places stay with you long after you leave. The hush of trees after rain. The creak of an old cabin settling at night. The way cold air carries stories through pine and stone. What the Woods Remember is a four-scent wax melt collection inspired by remote cabins, mountain air, moss-covered paths, and quiet moments far from everything else. Each scent reads like a chapter — familiar, grounded, and deeply comforting — designed to bring the feeling of the outdoors inside. These are the scents the woods keep. 1, Honeyed Orchard Pear The Welcome Back The memory of arriving just before dusk. A cabin door opening. Warm light spilling out. Juicy orchard pears and crisp apple unfold with a soft brightness, touched by citrus zest. Beneath it all, warm honeyed tea leaves, gentle spice, and smooth vanilla linger like something baking inside — familiar, comforting, and quietly inviting. This scent feels like coming home after a long drive through the trees. 2, High Timber Ridge The Forest After Rain The woods breathe differently after a storm. Mist clings to towering evergreens as fresh rain settles into moss and leaves. Cool petrichor and green nettle open the scent, followed by soft florals and damp earth. Cedarwood and rainwater anchor it all, creating a calm, clean atmosphere that feels untouched and expansive — like standing alone on a ridge with nothing but forest in every direction. 3, Old Mill Apple Bourbon Old Mill Apple BourboN. The Fire Is Lit The night settles in. The fire crackles low. Caramelized apples and rich maple blend seamlessly with smooth bourbon and soft spice. Vanilla and bakery notes warm the base, creating a nostalgic, slow-burning scent that feels like stories shared after dark. This is the heart of the cabin — cozy, worn-in, and deeply familiar. 4, Cold Creek Stone. Morning by the Water Cold air. Smooth stones. A quiet shoreline before the day begins. Mineral-rich air and fresh water notes open cool and clean, followed by cypress, sea salt, and weathered driftwood. Ambergris, cedar, and white musk settle beneath it all, creating a grounded, rugged finish. This scent feels still and reflective — the calm found near water, where everything slows. - Sunset Haven Scent Co.
