- [Natural Weight Loss Supplements | L-Carnitine For Fat Burning | MCT](https://valorbiolabs.com/products/extreme-burn-with-mct-natural-weight-loss-supplement): When Your Effort Doesn’t Match Your Results You train. You eat better. You stay consistent. Yet stubborn fat refuses to move. For many people, weight loss isn’t about willpower, it’s about metabolism. When your body struggles to efficiently convert nutrients into energy, progress slows and motivation fades. Extreme Burn with MCT is designed for individuals who want smarter support for their goals. By combining targeted nutrients and functional fats, this advanced formula helps support metabolic activity and energy utilization so your effort finally starts to feel rewarded. Targeted Metabolic Support with Functional Ingredients This comprehensive formula blends key vitamins, minerals, and metabolic compounds to support healthy energy metabolism and fat utilization. L-carnitine helps transport fatty acids into cells for energy production, while medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) provide a rapid energy source and may support thermogenesis.* Choline supports healthy liver function and fat metabolism, while chromium helps maintain normal blood sugar metabolism. Together, these ingredients work synergistically to help support metabolic performance, energy levels, and body composition when combined with a balanced diet and active lifestyle. Metabolism Slows Quietly—Until Progress Stops Metabolic efficiency doesn’t decline overnight. When fat burning slows, workouts feel less effective, energy dips, and results take longer to appear. Waiting only makes it harder to regain momentum. If weight management and metabolic health matter to you, proactive support is key. Extreme Burn with MCT helps reinforce your body’s natural fat-burning pathways before plateaus become permanent. Start supporting your metabolism now and let your progress catch up with your effort. Ingredients: Vitamin C (as acerbic acid), Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxine HCL), Choline (as choline bitartrate), Chromium (as chromium polynicotinate), Medium Chain Triglycerides Oil, CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid), GLA (Gamma-Linolenic Acid), Bladderwrack Thallus Powder, Inositol, Gymnema Sylvestre Leaf (25% Extract), Garcinia Cambogia Fruit Extract (50% hydroxycitric acid), L-Carnitine (as L-Carnitine Tartrate), Turmeric Root (95% extract), Coenzyme Q10, Proprietary Blend (Spirulina Powder, L-Phenylalanine, L-Tyrosine, L-Methionine, Bromelain, Psyllium Husk Powder, Clove Bud Powder,, Allspice, Kelp 10:1 Extract, Juniper Berry 4:1 Extract, Buchu Leaf 4:1 Extract, Uva Ursi Leaf (20% Extract), Cinnamon Bark 10:1 Extract (Cinnamomum cassia), Cranberry fruit Concentrate and Grapefruit Fruit 4:1 Extract), Gelatin (bovine), rice flour, vegetable magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide and chlorophyll.

- [Catalyst 100% Whey Protein Isolate Chocolate](https://valorbiolabs.com/products/catalyst-100-whey-protein-isolate): Nourish Your Muscles With Protein That Feels Effortless Every workout challenges your body. But real progress happens after the training - when your muscles repair, rebuild, and grow. Without the right nutrition, even the most intense workouts can leave you feeling drained instead of stronger. Catalyst is designed for those who demand more from their protein. With a smooth chocolate flavor and ultra-clean protein profile, it transforms daily nutrition into something both effective and enjoyable. Ultra-Pure Protein with Functional Nutrition Each serving delivers 22 grams of pure whey protein isolate, a fast-absorbing, high-quality protein ideal for muscle repair and growth.* Whey isolate is low in fat and lactose, making it suitable for lean nutrition and easy digestion. This premium formula is enhanced with apple pectin powder to support digestive comfort and MCT oil powder to provide quick energy and metabolic support. The natural vanilla flavor creates a creamy, satisfying taste without unnecessary additives. Missed Protein Today Means Missed Results Tomorrow Muscle growth doesn’t wait. When protein intake falls short, recovery slows, strength gains stall, and training intensity becomes harder to maintain. Over time, inconsistent nutrition can quietly undermine your progress. If your goals matter, your protein strategy should too. Catalyst helps ensure your muscles get the nutrition they need when it matters most. Start fueling recovery with precision, and let every workout count.

- [Energy Drink Powder | Focus Powder Supplement](https://valorbiolabs.com/products/volt-pre-workout-guava-berry-energy-drink-powder): Energy That Feels Controlled, Not Chaotic Most energy drinks deliver excitement first and regret later. The jitters, the crash, the fog that follows. When your day demands consistency, those highs and lows become a liability, not a boost. VOLT is designed for people who want clarity, control, and sustained performance. Whether you’re training, gaming, studying, or powering through long workdays, this premium formula delivers smooth energy and focused momentum without the sugar spikes or harsh crashes. Scientifically Balanced Formula for Sustained Energy This advanced energy supplement combines caffeine and L-theanine to support alertness while promoting a calm, focused mental state.* The result is steady energy rather than overstimulation. Beyond stimulants, VOLT includes electrolytes and essential nutrients to support hydration and overall wellness, helping maintain physical and mental performance throughout the day.* Every ingredient is carefully selected and precisely formulated to align with modern wellness goals and deliver consistent results.

- [NAD+ Benefits - Shop Now!](https://valorbiolabs.com/products/nad-benefits): Feel Energized at the Cellular Level True energy isn’t just about caffeine or sleep, it starts deep within your cells. When cellular energy slows, everything feels harder: focus fades, stamina drops, and recovery takes longer than it should. NAD+ is designed for supporting cellular energy and metabolic function. This advanced formula helps you feel more capable, alert, and ready for the demands of modern life. Recent large studies, particularly a major 2025 analysis of over 33,000 veterans, show oral nicotinamide significantly reduces the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) in high-risk individuals, with a 14% overall risk reduction, and a much stronger effect (54%) when started after the first skin cancer . This supports earlier research showing it reduces new skin cancers and pre-cancers by boosting cellular energy, enhancing DNA repair, and strengthening skin immunity against UV damage, with 500mg twice daily being a common recommendation, but always consult a doctor first. Advanced Support with NAD+, Quercetin & Resveratrol Each serving delivers 500 mg of NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), a critical coenzyme involved in cellular energy production and metabolic processes. This formula is enhanced with quercetin to support a healthy inflammatory response and immune function, along with resveratrol which is known for its role in supporting cardiovascular and cognitive wellness. Cellular Decline Doesn’t Announce Itself Cellular efficiency naturally decreases with age and lifestyle stress, but it rarely feels dramatic at first. Daily NAD+ support is most effective when it’s introduced early, not after fatigue becomes routine. If sustained energy, mental clarity, and long-term vitality matter to you, now is the moment to reinforce your cellular foundation. Ingredients: NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) (500 mg), Quercetin Dihydrate Extract (Sophora japonica) (whole flower bud) (250 mg), Japanese Knotweed Extract (98% Resveratrol) (Polygonum cuspidatum) (root) (150 mg), HPMC (vegetable capsule), Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC), Brown Rice Flour, Olive Oil, Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate. Manufacturer's country: USA Product amount: 60 capsules / 1.8 oz / 0.11 lb / 50 g Gross weight (oz/lb/g): 2.4 oz / 0.15 lb / 68 g Suggested use: As a dietary supplement, adults take two (2) capsules daily. For best results, take with 6oz (177ml) of water or as directed by  professional. Warning: Do not exceed recommended dose. Pregnant or nursing mothers, children under the age of 18, and individuals with known  conditions should consult a physician before using this or any dietary supplement.
