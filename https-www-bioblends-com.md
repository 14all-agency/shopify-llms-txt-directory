## Products

- [Liver Love](https://www.bioblends.com/products/liver-love): Your liver plays a crucial role in your energy, the detoxification and elimination of problematic substances (‘toxins’), hormone balance and clear skin — fundamentally shaping how you look and feel each day. Nourish and protect this vital organ with Liver Love, a potent blend designed for optimal liver health and detoxification. “Liver loaders” enter the body via what we eat, drink and absorb through our skin – helping them leave the body efficiently can make a significant difference to how we feel each day.

- [Organic Zinc](https://www.bioblends.com/products/organic-zinc-extract): Imagine you have a bucket inside you that can hold zinc. You want it nice and full, so zinc can be supplied when and where it’s needed. If the bucket doesn’t have much zinc in it, the body will have to prioritise where zinc goes, meaning numerous processes that require it, won’t be able to function well or at all. Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a pivotal role in maintaining so many aspects of health, particularly robust immune function, digestion, hormone production, mood, wound healing and skin clarity, as well as hair and nail quality – it’s indispensable to a wide range of physiological functions. Despite its importance, zinc deficiency is surprisingly common, typically due to inadequate dietary intake from diminished top soil quality.

They work synergistically to reduce anxious feelings, alleviate irritability and promote a deep sense of calm. It's perfect for anyone feeling 'tired but wired' or struggling to unwind.

- [Meno Ease](https://www.bioblends.com/products/meno-magic): Meno Ease is for those seeking relief from hormone-related symptoms once menstruation has ceased or become highly irregular (such as three periods per year). Perimenopause has three stages, the last of which is the lead up to menopause, which is the 12 month anniversary of your last period. In this last stage of perimenopause as well as post-menopause, estrogen is low and ovulation has ceased, meaning progesterone is also low (only the adrenal production remains). Some women cruise through the menopausal transition while others suffer mildly or in a debilitating way.&nbsp;

- [Fix Iron First by Dr Libby](https://www.bioblends.com/products/fix-iron-first): Fix Iron First - Dr Libby's new book out now You don’t have to accept feeling flat, foggy, anxious or exhausted as your “new normal”. When iron levels are low, everything feels harder. Your energy fades. Your mood shifts. Your resilience diminishes. And your body simply cannot function at its best – because so many of its vital processes depend on robust iron stores. Yet too often, the true impact of low iron is missed or misunderstood. Many people know – or suspect — that their iron is low, but they don’t realise how deeply it could be affecting them. Some have tried to correct it, only to find themselves back where they started. Others haven’t truly addressed it yet, thinking it couldn’t possibly be behind how lousy they feel. What’s not recognised often enough is that low iron doesn’t just make you tired. It can alter your brain chemistry, slow your metabolism, impact your thyroid, disturb your sleep and lower your emotional resilience. It affects how you think, how you feel, how you show up in the world – every single day. Fix Iron First is a call to change that. This book is for anyone who has ever felt persistently tired, anxious, low in mood, or disconnected from their spark – and not known why. It’s for parents watching a child struggle with energy or concentration. It’s for women navigating the rhythms of their menstrual cycle or the shifts of perimenopause. It’s for anyone who feels like they’re “doing everything right” but still doesn’t feel like themselves – or who has tried, unsuccessfully, to restore their iron levels and is still searching for answers.
