Chateau which was built between 12th - 13th centuries by the Count of Savoy is now in ruins but you can imagine what would have been the dungeons in the citadel! From Chateau we take the walk steadily uphill to Marlenaz where we have lunch and then go downhill to Savoleyre. Savoleyre - Pierre Avoi - Savoleyres This is an impressive walk from Savoleyre to the top of Pierre Avon 2473m, part of the Swiss Pennine Alps and overlooks not only Verbier but also into the Rhone valley and Saxon. The ascent is a straightforward walk to the foot of Pierre Avoi and then a short section of 2 ladders to the summit. The return route can be taken the same way to Savoleyres. Please enquire for set lunch prices.

This 100% organic cotton tee is sure to become their favorite! • Dispatched from UK & EU • 100% organic ring-spun combed cotton • Fabric weight: 4.57 oz/yd² (155 g/m²) • Single jersey • Medium fit • Set-in sleeves • 1×1 rib at collar • Narrow double-needle topstitch on the sleeves and bottom hems • Self-fabric neck tape (inside, back of the neck) • Blank product sourced from Bangladesh The sizes correspond to a smaller size in the US market, so US customers should order a size up. This product is made especially for you as soon as you place an order, which is why it takes us a bit longer to deliver it to you. Making products on demand instead of in bulk helps reduce overproduction, so thank you for making thoughtful purchasing decisions!Size guide BODY LENGTH (inches) CHEST WIDTH (inches) SLEEVE LENGTH (inches) 3-4 16 ½ 13 4 ½ 5-6 18 ⅛ 13 ¾ 4 ⅞ 7-8 20 ¼ 14 ⅝ 5 ¾ 9-11 22 ⅝ 16 ⅛ 6 ½ 12-13 24 ⅝ 17 ¼ 7 ¼ BODY LENGTH (cm) CHEST WIDTH (cm) SLEEVE LENGTH (cm) 3-4 42 33 11.4 5-6 46 35 12.5 7-8 51.6 37 14.5 9-11 57.4 40.9 16.5 12-13 62.5 44 18.5
