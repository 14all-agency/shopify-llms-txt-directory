- [KeraFactor® Combo System](https://shop.mykerafactor.com/products/kerafactor-solution-and-conditioner-combo): What's in the Box?: KeraFactor Scalp Stimulating Solution KeraFactor Scalp Stimulating Shampoo and Conditioner KeraFactor Scalp Stimulating Wet & Dry Brush Scalp Stimulating Solution Each highly concentrated 50ml bottle of KeraFactor Solution contains the proprietary KeraFactor Peptide Complex (KFP™). KFP is a unique formula that contains 7 Polypeptides that include both specifically selected growth factors and skin proteins to help with hair and scalp health. This patented complex helps to "turn on" weak or resting hair follicles and improve scalp circulation and nutrients to produce thicker, longer healthy-looking hair. In addition to the solution, each bottle contains a dropper applicator for specific and efficient delivery of the KFP to the scalp and surrounding follicles. Use 1 full dropper morning or night on dry or wet hair, massage onto scalp. KeraFactor Shampoo and Conditioner The KeraFactor Shampoo and Conditioner exfoliates and stimulates the scalp and hair using a unique combination of conditioners and growth factors designed to enhance scalp circulation and reinvigorate the scalp and hair, leading to hair that appears fuller, has more body, and is healthier. Each 100ml bottle has enough quantity to be used daily for at least 1 month. Only a pea-sized drop is used and lathered before massaging into the scalp. Leave in for 1 minute before rinsing. It is recommended for patients with significant hair to use regular shampoo first and use it as more of a scalp and hair treatment than a shampoo wash. Lastly, condition your ends with your regular conditioner. Scalp Stimulating Brush We recommend using the brush on wet or dry hair with small circular or back and forth motions. The gently curved brush is designed to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. The soft bristles are contoured to effectively remove debris and increase circulation on the scalp. Directions: Use this brush to massage the scalp with any KeraFactor Scalp Stimulating products. Warning: Do not over-scrub, the scalp should be in a light pink color. If prolonged redness or irritation persists in the scalp, please discontinue immediately. NanoFluorosomes: We are very happy to announce the next generation of our proprietary KeraFactor formula, Kerafactor with Nanofluorosomes. Nanofluorosomes are a technology that we have been working on for quite a while at KeraFactor and the new KeraFactor take-home solution is the first to include this new compound. What is a nanofluorosome and why are we so excited to add it to our products? Since the beginning of KeraFactor, we have strived to be the best fertilizer for the scalp, but we also know that being the fertilizer is not good enough alone you also have to try and reduce inflammation and follicle miniaturization. This is where the nanofluorosomes come in. We found a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic compound and wrapped it into our nanoliposome technology to create a nanofluorosome. What makes the compound even more special is that it is naturally fluorescent, which means this compound can be additionally activated with the correct laser or light source. This is why we call it a nanofluorosome and why this new formula has a yellowish glow to it. Nanofluorosomes can be activated by laser hair caps or machines in the 630-690nm range. Which is already used by many patients to improve hair and scalp circulation and inflammation, now they can add this new formula to their at-home laser routine for even better results. Possible Adverse Reactions: Scalp irritation, rash, or temporary redness. If a reaction occurs, please discontinue use. Warning: Avoid this product if you are allergic to Curcumin. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water. Keep out of reach of children. Not intended for use by pregnant or nursing women or by any person under the age of 18. If you are taking any medications, consult with your doctor or health professional before use. Storage: Keep in a cool place. Do not freeze.
