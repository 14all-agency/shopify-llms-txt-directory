<div style="text-align: left;">Foraging reminds us that mother nature gives freely and abundantly. Before harvesting, take a moment to show appreciation for the plant.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">This can look different for everyone. Some people say a prayer, sing, or leave tobacco. I like to thank the plant, and leave a piece of my hair. Little by little, the connection between you and the plant will grow stronger.</div>
