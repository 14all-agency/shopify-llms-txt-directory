Each server running SQL Server software requires a server license. Each user and/or device accessing a licensed SQL Server requires a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer - for example, to access a SQL Server 2012 Standard Edition server, a user would need a SQL Server 2012 or 2017 CAL. Each SQL Server CAL allows access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including Standard Edition and legacy Business Intelligence and Enterprise Edition Servers. Option #2 PER CORE: Gives a more precise measurement of computing power and a more consistent metric, regardless of whether solutions are deployed on physical servers on-premises, or in virtual/cloud environments. Core based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet workloads, or have systems that integrate with external facing workloads.
