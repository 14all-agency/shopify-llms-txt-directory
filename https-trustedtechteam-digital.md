- [Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Standard - 2 Core Download](https://trustedtechteam.digital/products/microsoft-sql-server-2022-standard-2-core-download-license): Secure Your Data With SQL Server Query and analyze your data using industry-leading performance and security. How to License SQL Server Standard Option #1 SERVER + CAL: Provides the option to license users and/or devices, with low-cost access to incremental SQL Server deployments. Each server running SQL Server software requires a server license. Each user and/or device accessing a licensed SQL Server requires a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer - for example, to access a SQL Server 2017 Standard Edition server, a user would need a SQL Server 2017, 2019, or 2022 CAL. Each SQL Server CAL allows access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including Standard Edition and legacy Business Intelligence and Enterprise Edition Servers. Option #2 PER CORE: Gives a more precise measurement of computing power and a more consistent metric, regardless of whether solutions are deployed on physical servers on-premises, or in virtual/cloud environments. Core based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet workloads, or have systems that integrate with external facing workloads. To license a physical server—when running SQL Server in a physical OSE—all physical cores on the server must be licensed. A minimum of four core licenses are required for each physical processor on the server. SQL Server Features: Standard vs. Enterprise SQL Server Features Standard Enterprise Compute and storage Maximum number of cores 24 OS Max Maximum memory utilized per instance 128 GB OS Max Maximum size 524 PB 524 PB Intelligence over all your data SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Apache Spark and HDFS built into SQL Server engine Data virtualization using PolyBase (including additional data sources like Oracle, Teradata, MongoDB, and other SQL Server databases) Unified AI platform to train and operationalize models with SQL Server ML Services Azure Machine Learning and Spark ML Choice of language and platform Compatibility certfication UTF-8 Support Support for SQL Server Java extension Industry-leading performance and availability Free DR replicas in Azure and on-premises Intelligent Query processing: Scalar UDF inlining, table variable deferred compilation, approximate count distinct Intelligent Query processing features: row mode memory grant feedback, batch mode for row store and automatic tuning Automatic read-write connection re-routing In-Memory Database: memory-optimized tempdb In-Memory Database: Persistent Memory support Accelerated Database recovery Support for Kubernetes deployment Secure and reliable Always Encrypted with secure enclaves Transparent database encryption Data classification and auditing Vulnerability assessment Quick business insights Azure Data Studio to manage SQL Server including support for T-SQL using Notebooks SQL Server Analysis Services Direct Query Microsoft SQL Server has been one of the premier leaders in database technology for years. Store and retrieve data with the powerful and intuitive Microsoft SQL Server Standard. Available here as a two-core license with Software Assurance from Microsoft, this software package is an excellent investment for those looking to expand their business on the server side. (Note that Microsoft software licensing terms require a minimum of four cores to be licensed with the core model.) Order here at Trusted Tech Team to take advantage of free installation support from a Microsoft Cloud Solutions Partner. New to SQL Licensing?

- [Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop - 5 User CAL](https://trustedtechteam.digital/products/microsoft-windows-server-2016-remote-desktop-user-cal-5-pack): Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop User CAL License Need help determining your licensing scenario? Take a look at the guide below: Windows Server Licensing Guide *This product includes 5 RDS User CALs. User or Device CAL? How to choose: User CAL – Gives your 5 users the right to access the terminal server from any of their devices including their workstation in the office, laptop/desktop at home, or mobile device. Why User CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have more devices than users. Only 1 user CAL would be required to cover “X” number of devices. User CALs are Trusted Tech Team's recommendation. They're cheaper to license and offer more flexibility. Device CAL – Gives a specific device the ability to access the terminal server such as a workstation in the office or a tablet used to take customer orders. Why Device CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have numerous users who all access the same device to remote into the server. This method is typically seen in medical offices or warehouses in which the same device has more than one user throughout the day. You will only need to purchase one CAL for each device instead of numerous user CAL for each user. Overview: To ensure you are in compliance with the licensing terms, you will want to keep a head count on the number of device/users accessing the terminal server. If no CALs are available, the remote users will be blocked out from accessing the terminal server. Speak with our licensing experts today to ensure you are in compliance! For Microsoft Windows Server 2016 RD customers that employ a device CAL licensing model, Trusted Tech Team has the licenses you need to grow your business. Device CALs are a great choice for small businesses as they allow an unlimited number of users to access the software through a shared device. Our five device CAL package contains enough licenses to add up to five more devices, increasing your company’s capabilities significantly. Our device CALs are designed for use with Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop and are priced competitively. Order now and enjoy fast digital delivery for same-day use. Whichever solution you choose, you have another layer of flexibility when it comes to content that is published to your users: Desktop: Your IT admin will be able to push any applications, folders, and documentation onto each user's session. All sessions have the ability to include or exclude any content. This method is preferred if your users are going to be utilizing their remote session as their primary workstation. RemoteApps: Preferred if you want to host your applications on a virtual machine as if they're directly on your user's desktops. Typically used when you want to manage applications in a secure, remote environment. For more information regarding the Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop User CAL License, contact us at (855) 202-8140 or support@TrustedTechTeam.com.

- [Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop - 5 User CAL](https://trustedtechteam.digital/products/microsoft-windows-server-2016-remote-desktop-5-user-cal-pack): Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop 5 User CAL License Need help determining your licensing scenario? Take a look at the guide below: Windows Server Licensing Guide *This product includes 5 RDS User CALs Windows Server 2016 introduces brand new possibilities with all of the newly upgraded features. Until now, containers have existed almost entirely in the Linux/UNIX open-source world. They allow you to isolate applications and services in an agile, easy-to-administer way. Windows Server 2016 offers two different types of containers for Windows Server instances: Windows Server Container. This container type is intended for low-trust workloads where you don't mind that container instances running on the same server may share some common resources. Hyper-V Container. This isn't a Hyper-V host or VM. Instead, its a super isolated, containerized Windows Server instance that is completely isolated from other containers and potentially from the host server. Hyper-V containers are appropriate for high-trust workloads. User or Device CAL? How to choose: User CAL – Grants up to 5 users the right to access your office's terminal server from any of their devices including their workstation in the office, laptop/desktop at home, or mobile device. Why User CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have more devices than users. Only 1 user CAL would be required to cover “X” number of devices. User CALs are Trusted Tech Team's recommendation. They're cheaper to license and offer more flexibility. Device CAL – Grants a specific device the ability to access the terminal server such as a workstation in the office or a tablet used to take customer orders. Why Device CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have numerous users who all access the same device to remote into the server. This method is typically seen in medical offices or warehouses in which the same device has more than one user throughout the day. You will only need to purchase one CAL for each device instead of numerous user CAL for each user. Overview: To ensure you are in compliance with the licensing terms, you will want to keep a head count on the number of device/users accessing the terminal server. If no CALs are available, the remote users will be blocked out from accessing the terminal server. Speak with our licensing experts today to ensure you are in compliance! Whichever solution you choose, you have another layer of flexibility when it comes to content that is published to your users: Desktop: Your IT admin will be able to push any applications, folders, and documentation onto each user's session. All sessions have the ability to include or exclude any content. This method is preferred if your users are going to be utilizing their remote session as their primary workstation. RemoteApps: Preferred if you want to host your applications on a virtual machine as if they're directly on your user's desktops. Typically used when you want to manage applications in a secure, remote environment.

Download the infographic How to License SQL Server Standard Option #1 SERVER + CAL: Provides the option to license users and/or devices, with low-cost access to incremental SQL Server deployments. Each server running SQL Server software requires a server license. Each user and/or device accessing a licensed SQL Server requires a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer - for example, to access a SQL Server 2012 Standard Edition server, a user would need a SQL Server 2012 or 2017 CAL. Each SQL Server CAL allows access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including Standard Edition and legacy Business Intelligence and Enterprise Edition Servers. Option #2 PER CORE: Gives a more precise measurement of computing power and a more consistent metric, regardless of whether solutions are deployed on physical servers on-premises, or in virtual/cloud environments. Core based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet workloads, or have systems that integrate with external facing workloads. To license a physical server—when running SQL Server in a physical OSE—all physical cores on the server must be licensed.
