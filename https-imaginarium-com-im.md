WARNING: This journal may inspire you to give impromptu rousing speeches, question your friends' loyalty, or dramatically declare "Et tu, Brute?" at moments of betrayal. We are not responsible for any political upheavals, revenge plots, or the sudden urge to lend people your ears (metaphorically, of course!). • 150 lined pages for your most ambitious plans • Hardcover durability (unlike Caesar's trust in the Senate)• Perfect for manifestation, dream journals, spell work, or plotting your rise to power • Ideal gift for history lovers, Shakespeare enthusiasts, Skakespeare , Performing arts students and Theatre Players & Students, and anyone who appreciates dramatic irony • Brings Roman drama and legendary rhetoric to your daily writing Whether you're journaling your tarot readings, making script notes. tracking your manifestations, or just need a place to record your thoughts while remembering to beware the Ides of March (and backstabbing friends), this journal celebrates one of history's most famous assassinations and the speech that changed everything.
