- [the Orleans & the Constable at_Agincourt_HC_Journal](https://imaginarium.com.im/products/aajs_sss_the_orleans_-agincourt_hc_journal): Introducing a beautifully crafted Hardcover Journal, designed to inspire creativity and capture your thoughts. This journal radiates a sophisticated vibe, making it the perfect companion for writers, artists, Shakespeare students or anyone who enjoys journaling. The matte laminated cover not only adds a sleek finish but also ensures durability, allowing you to take your journal anywhere with ease. Whether at home, in the office, or on the go, this journal seamlessly integrates into your daily life. It’s a thoughtful gift for students, professionals, or literary enthusiasts, making it suitable for various occasions such as birthdays, holidays, or as a special treat for yourself. Celebrate your creativity with this stunning journal! Journal Height, cm 20.50 Width, cm 14.50 Depth, cm 1.40 Description: The Duke of Orleans and the Constable of France—two men radiating the kind of overconfidence that makes historians wince. This hardcover journal captures these French nobles moments before the Battle of Agincourt, heads together in conversation, probably mocking the English army's shabby appearance and making bets on how quickly they'll win. Spoiler alert: it went spectacularly badly for them, and Henry V had the last laugh. With 150 lined pages, this journal is perfect for recording your ambitious plans, bold predictions, or those moments when you're absolutely certain everything will go your way (we recommend a backup plan). The cover features these doomed nobles in all their pre-battle glory, reminding you that pride comes before a fall—and sometimes before a very muddy battlefield. WARNING: This journal may inspire you to underestimate your opponents, make overconfident predictions, or ignore good advice from people who actually know what they're talking about. We are not responsible for any hubris-related disasters, unexpected defeats, or the sudden realization that longbows are more effective than you thought. • 150 lined pages for your grandest schemes • Hardcover durability (unlike French morale at Agincourt) • Perfect for manifestation, dream journals, spell work, or strategic planning • Ideal gift for history buffs, Shakespeare lovers, and anyone who needs a reminder to stay humble • Brings medieval drama and cautionary tales to your daily writing Whether you're journaling your tarot readings, tracking your manifestations, making script notes or just need a place to record your plans while remembering that sometimes the underdog wins, this journal celebrates one of Shakespeare's most dramatic historical moments and the timeless lesson about overconfidence. Product features- Matte laminated cover for a smooth, durable finish.- Vibrant colors achieved through advanced printing techniques.- Perforated pages for easy tearing and sharing.- Flexible casewrap binding that adapts to your needs.- 150 lined pages offering ample space for your thoughts.
