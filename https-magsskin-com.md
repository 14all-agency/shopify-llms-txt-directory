## Products

- [MAGS Skin Deodorant For Sensitive Skin](https://magsskin.com/products/mags-skin-deodorant): A dermatologist- solution for sensitive underarms. No rubbing, no irritation, just clean confidence. MAGS Skin is made with magnesium, a naturally occurring mineral that helps neutralize odor-causing bacteria without disrupting your skin’s pH. Unlike traditional deodorants that rely on aluminum, baking soda, or fragrance, MAGS Skin keeps odor in check without triggering stinging, flare-ups, or discomfort. And because it’s a spray, there’s no need to rub or apply pressure to already sensitive skin making it ideal for anyone dealing with eczema, psoriasis, post-shave irritation, or dermatitis. It’s fast-drying, non-toxic, and safe enough to use every single day. In user trials with 307 participants: 96% said they stayed odor-free for 24 hours 92% experienced no irritation, stinging, or redness 89% would recommend MAGS Skin to friends

- [BIA Eczema Relief Lotion](https://magsskin.com/products/bia-eczema-relief-lotion): As our largest organ, skin’s primary job is to serve as a physical barrier to the outside world. For skin to properly perform its protective function, it must be adequately hydrated. Healthy skin feels soft, smooth, and plump. When skin becomes dehydrated, both its appearance and protective function begin to deteriorate; it becomes dry, flaky, and itchy. When skin dries out (and it’s the last organ to re-hydrate), the skin barrier begins to degrade, leading to more rapid water loss. This degradation accelerates with daily exposure to environmental stressors (sun/pollution) and the degree of degradation accumulates with age. Hence, as one gets older, an increase in the frequency of applying water-containing skincare products is needed. While water-containing formulations do re-hydrate the skin, this effect is only temporary due to evaporation. To lock in this moisture, formulations must contain ingredients that attract water present externally in the air and internally within the lower layers of the skin. They must also form a moisture sealing layer on the skin’s surface to slow the evaporation process. The Bia collection is focused on hydration, moisture retention, and cleansing without stripping moisture in a way that also supports the microbiome. Our BiaComplex® 2.0 was specifically designed to soothe dry skin, help shed its outer dry layers, moisturize, and seal in water by forming a protective barrier. BIA now includes the first OTC product containing active 1% Colloidal Oatmeal for eczema.
