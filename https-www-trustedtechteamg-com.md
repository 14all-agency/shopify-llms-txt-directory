- [Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Standard - 2 Core Elite Pricing](https://www.trustedtechteamg.com/products/microsoft-sql-server-2019-standard-2-core-license-elite-pricing): *Microsoft Software Licensing terms require a minimum of 4 cores to be licensed with the core model* Secure Your Data With SQL Server 2019 Query and analyze your data using industry-leading performance and security. Download the infographic How to License SQL Server Standard Option #1 SERVER + CAL: Provides the option to license users and/or devices, with low-cost access to incremental SQL Server deployments. Each server running SQL Server software requires a server license. Each user and/or device accessing a licensed SQL Server requires a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer - for example, to access a SQL Server 2012 Standard Edition server, a user would need a SQL Server 2012 or 2019 CAL. Each SQL Server CAL allows access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including Standard Edition and legacy Business Intelligence and Enterprise Edition Servers. Option #2 PER CORE: Gives a more precise measurement of computing power and a more consistent metric, regardless of whether solutions are deployed on physical servers on-premises, or in virtual/cloud environments. Core based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet workloads, or have systems that integrate with external facing workloads. To license a physical server—when running SQL Server in a physical OSE—all physical cores on the server must be licensed. A minimum of four core licenses are required for each physical processor on the server.

How to License SQL Server Standard Option #1 SERVER + CAL: Provides the option to license users and/or devices, with low-cost access to incremental SQL Server deployments. Each server running SQL Server software requires a server license. Each user and/or device accessing a licensed SQL Server requires a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer - for example, to access a SQL Server 2017 Standard Edition server, a user would need a SQL Server 2017, 2019, or 2022 CAL. Each SQL Server CAL allows access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including Standard Edition and legacy Business Intelligence and Enterprise Edition Servers. Option #2 PER CORE: Gives a more precise measurement of computing power and a more consistent metric, regardless of whether solutions are deployed on physical servers on-premises, or in virtual/cloud environments. Core based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet workloads, or have systems that integrate with external facing workloads. To license a physical server—when running SQL Server in a physical OSE—all physical cores on the server must be licensed. A minimum of four core licenses are required for each physical processor on the server.

Are you constantly adding new devices to your network? License them with Device CALs from Microsoft. Here, you can instantly order 1 Device CAL for Microsoft Exchange 2016 Standard from our Microsoft Cloud Solutions Partners at Trusted Tech Team. Order with us today! Features to Expect with Exchange 2016 The Mailbox server in Exchange 2016 includes all of the server components from the Exchange 2013 Mailbox and Client Access server roles: the Client Access protocols, Transport service, Mailbox databases, and Unified Messaging. The Mailbox server handles all activity for the active mailboxes on that server. Client Access services provide authentication, limited redirection, and proxy services. Client Access services don't do any data rendering and offer all the usual client access protocols: HTTP, POP and IMAP, and SMTP. Along with the new Mailbox role, Exchange 2016 now allows you to proxy traffic from Exchange 2013 to Exchange 2016 in addition to Exchange 2016 to Exchange 2013. This new flexibility gives you more control in how you move to Exchange 2016 without having to worry about deploying enough front-end capacity to service new Exchange 2016 servers. The Edge Transport role is typically deployed in your perimeter network, outside your internal Active Directory forest, and is designed to minimize the attack surface of your Exchange deployment. By handling all Internet-facing mail flow, it also adds additional layers of message protection and security against viruses and spam, and can apply transport rules to control message flow.

Take a look below Windows Server CAL Licensing Guide Licensing Requirements Once the licensing grace period is passed, you must have a license for each connecting user or device to connect to an RD Session Host server. You will also need to install an RD Licensing server. You can install the RD Licensing role service on the same server or on a separate server. Client Access Licenses (CALs) must be purchased and installed on the RD Licensing Server. Though these CALs will be tied to the server, it is possible to move them to new hardware if needed. RDS supports per-user and per-device licensing, and your choice between the two is based on if you have more users or computers in your network. Install the RD Licensing role service just as you did the RD Session Host role service. Then you must: Activate the RD Licensing server Install RDS CALs so the RD Licensing server can allocate them to users and devices Tell the RD Session Host server to use the RD Licensing server (you must do this even if the two role services are located on the same machine) If you do build a virtual RD Session Host server, you should probably use a server with a processor supporting second-level address translation (SLAT) to reduce the overhead of memory mapping between the physical machine and the VMs. To reduce overhead, it's also advisable to use a Type 1 hypervisor like Hyper-V, not a Type 2.

Take a look below Windows Server CAL Licensing Guide Licensing Requirements Once the licensing grace period is passed, you must have a license for each connecting user or device to connect to an RD Session Host server. You will also need to install an RD Licensing server. You can install the RD Licensing role service on the same server (the service isn't memory intensive) or on a separate server. Youll need to purchase RDS Client Access Licenses (CALs) and install them on the RD Licensing server. These RDS CALs are tied to the server, but RDS lets you move them to new hardware if needed. Remember that RDS supports both per-user and per-device licensing. The model you choose should depend on whether you have more users or computers. RDS does not have concurrent-user licensing, and the licenses you choose must match the mode for which you configure the RD Session Host server. Install the RD Licensing role service just as you did the RD Session Host role service. Then you must: Activate the RD Licensing server Install RDS CALs so the RD Licensing server can allocate them to users and devices Tell the RD Session Host server to use the RD Licensing server (you must do this even if the two role services are located on the same machine) If you choose to virtualize an RD Session Host Server, you are likely to see a reduced number of simultaneous sessions it can support. It is recommended to use a server with a processor supporting Second-Level Address Translation (SLAT) to reduce overhead memory mapping between physical and virtual machines. Windows Server 2012 has more Hyper V capabilities so you can isolate network traffic from different business units or customers on a shared infrastructure without using VLANs. Hyper V Network Virtualization also lets you move virtual machines as needed within your virtual infrastructure while preserving their virtual network assignments.

- [Windows Server 2016 - 1 Remote Desktop User CAL - Elite Pricing](https://www.trustedtechteamg.com/products/windows-server-2016-1-remote-desktop-user-cal-elite-pricing): Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop User CAL License - Elite Pricing Allows for one concurrent connection into the server remotely. Each user can access the server from any of their devices. Need help determining your licensing scenario? Take a look at the guide below: Windows Server Licensing Guide *This product includes 1 RDS User CAL. Windows Server 2016 has a list of great new features, including compatibility with Azure SQL Database.The RD Connection Broker is able to store all of the deployment information, like connection states and user/host mappings, in a shared SQL database, like Azure. Ditch the SQL Server Always On Availability Group deployment manual, grab the connection string to the Azure SQL database, and start using your highly available environment instantly. User or Device CAL? How to choose: User CAL – Grants one user the ability to access the terminal server from any of their devices including their workstation in the office, laptop/desktop at home, or mobile device. Why User CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have more devices than users. Only 1 user CAL would be required to cover “X” number of devices. User CALs are Trusted Tech Team's recommendation. They're cheaper to license and offer more flexibility. Device CAL – Grants a specific device the ability to access the terminal server such as a workstation in the office or a tablet used to take customer orders. Why Device CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have numerous users who all access the same device to remote into the server. This method is typically seen in medical offices or warehouses in which the same device has more than one user throughout the day. You will only need to purchase one CAL for each device instead of numerous user CAL for each user. Overview: To ensure you are in compliance with the licensing terms, you will want to keep a head count on the number of device/users accessing the terminal server. If no CALs are available, the remote users will be blocked out from accessing the terminal server. Speak with our licensing experts today to ensure you are in compliance! Whichever solution you choose, you have another layer of flexibility when it comes to content that is published to your users: Desktop: Your IT admin will be able to push any applications, folders, and documentation onto each user's session. All sessions have the ability to include or exclude any content. This method is preferred if your users are going to be utilizing their remote session as their primary workstation. RemoteApps: Preferred if you want to host your applications on a virtual machine as if they're directly on your user's desktops. Typically used when you want to manage applications in a secure, remote environment. For more information regarding the Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop CAL License, contact us at (855) 202-8140 or support@TrustedTechTeam.com.

How to choose: User CAL – Grants your 5 remote users the right to access the terminal server from any of their devices including their workstation in the office, laptop/desktop at home, or mobile device. Why User CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have more devices than users. Only 1 user CAL would be required to cover “X” number of devices. User CALs are Trusted Tech Team's recommendation. They're cheaper to license and offer more flexibility. Device CAL – Grants a specific device the ability to access the terminal server such as a workstation in the office or a tablet used to take customer orders. Why Device CAL? It will be more cost effective if you have numerous users who all access the same device to remote into the server. This method is typically seen in medical offices or warehouses in which the same device has more than one user throughout the day. You will only need to purchase one CAL for each device instead of numerous user CAL for each user. Overview: To ensure you are in compliance with the licensing terms, you will want to keep a head count on the number of device/users accessing the terminal server. If no CALs are available, the remote users will be blocked out from accessing the terminal server. Speak with our licensing experts today to ensure you are in compliance! Whichever solution you choose, you have another layer of flexibility when it comes to content that is published to your users: Desktop: Your IT admin will be able to push any applications, folders, and documentation onto each user's session. All sessions have the ability to include or exclude any content. This method is preferred if your users are going to be utilizing their remote session as their primary workstation. RemoteApps: Preferred if you want to host your applications on a virtual machine as if they're directly on your user's desktops. Typically used when you want to manage applications in a secure, remote environment.

- [Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Essentials - Elite Pricing](https://www.trustedtechteamg.com/products/microsoft-windows-server-2016-essentials-elite-pricing): Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Essentials - Elite Pricing Need help determining your licensing scenario? Take a look at the guide below: Windows Server Licensing Guide Windows Server 2016 Essentials Edition is a cloud-connected first server system that is ideal for small businesses with no more than 25 users and 50 devices. 2016 Essentials is an excellent option for customers currently using the Foundation edition, which is not available with Windows Server 2016. FEATURES Some of the new features integrated with Windows Server 2016 Essentials include: Azure Site Recovery Services When a virtual machine that is protected from threats stops working, or the host server that it all runs on fails, Azure Site Recovery Services allows users to maintain business continuity until the virtual machine or host server on-premises is repaired and made available. Azure Site Recovery Services, a feature in Microsoft Azure, allows a replication of your virtual machines (VM) to be done in real time and sends it to a backup vault in Azure. If your server or site goes down due to faulty hardware or another failure, you can fail-over with Azure Site Recovery so that the virtual machine image stored in your backup vault will be provisioned as a running VM in Microsoft Azure. Combined with an Azure Virtual Network, client PCs that previously connected to the server on-premises will connect to the server running in Azure. Azure Virtual Network As organizations transfer their workloads to cloud computing, they seldom move all of their resources all at once. They instead move some resources to the cloud and keep some on the premises. It's much easier to move an organization to the cloud in stages over time. Azure Virtual Network integration provides the network infrastructure that makes that process seamless and manageable. Azure Virtual networking is a service that enables organizations to create a point-to-point (P2P) or site-to-site (S2S) virtual private network that makes resources that are running in Azure (such as virtual machines and storage) look as though they are on the local network for seamless access to applications and resources. Larger Deployments Support Some medium-sized businesses need more functionality and capacity to implement Windows Server Essentials. Windows Server 2016 Essentials provides increases the manageability of domains, users, and devices by adding support for larger deployments with multiple domains and domain controllers as well as ability to specify a designated domain controller.
