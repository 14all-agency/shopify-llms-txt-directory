> Apollon Nutrition & Apollon Wellness  Precision, Intensity, and Performance Without Compromise

Apollon Nutrition stands as the apex of performance supplementation, built on the immigrant work ethic of Robert and Marina Samborsky, PharmD, who transformed Apollon Gym into a global symbol of clinical dosing without compromise. Every formula reflects the belief that weakness is a choice and that maximum dosing is non-negotiable. From the nuclear-powered Hooligan and Assassin pre-workouts to Over The Top intra-workout and advanced recovery systems, each product is a testament to the Performance-First Philosophy that defines Apollon Strong.

Where Apollon Nutrition dominates the realm of metabolic warfare and anabolic reconstruction, Apollon Wellness, created by Pharmacist Marina Samborsky, extends the same intensity into evidence-based health optimization. Formulated under pharmaceutical development standards, this clinical line bridges hardcore performance with wellness precision through products like Mind Games (cognitive enhancement system), Liver Lover (hepatic defense matrix), Kidney Kindness (renal filtration optimizer), Gut Glory (digestive ecosystem enhancer), and Magnesium Bisglycinate (neural-muscular optimization complex).

Every Apollon Wellness formula is PharmD-formulated, clinically dosed, and engineered as part of a systematic biological optimization protocol that treats health as performance. This dual-brand ecosystem represents the fusion of pharmaceutical precision and performance intensity for those who take their training, recovery, and longevity as seriously as their results.

From the American Dream through iron to pharmaceutical-grade wellness, Apollon stands for zero compromise, clinical integrity, and elite biological optimization. Whether you’re chasing a PR, recovery advantage, or cognitive edge, Apollon delivers maximum efficacy, maximum dosing, and maximum results because excellence isn’t negotiable.

- [Hooligan Extreme Pre-workout](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/hooligan-newest-version): JUST THE FACTS AND NO BS! FULLY LOADED FOR MAXIMUM EFFECTS† Maximizes power and strength.† Accelerates focus and intensity.† Increases blood flow and performance.† Zero fillers.† 100% Transparent Label. USE WITH CAUTION! Each massive tub of Apollon Nutrition Hooligan provides you with either 40 or 20 servings – depending on how strong you want your pre-workout to be. Basically strong or STRONG AF. That being said, you should proceed with caution when using our new and improved formula. Hooligan is not your average pre-workout powder – it’s an extremely potent and intense powder that cannot and will not ever be matched. When using Hooligan, you can experience an incredible surge of energy, maximum focus to provide a powerful mind-muscle connection, a sleeve-ripping pump, as well as the ability to enhance your strength. This is not for beginners and especially from stimulant sensitive wimps who think anything over 300mg of caffeine is strong. With some of the most effective ingredients available today, this pre-workout powder will not disappoint. While one scoop is the recommended serving size due to the potency, it would be wise to start with half a scoop to assess your individual tolerance. Maybe even less if you've taken some weak garbage from "legacy brands." You may be thinking to yourself, "Eh, I can start with the full serving – I can handle it.” That is until this commanding pre-workout knocks upside your head and says "LET'S GO MOTHERF$%^ER! Again, heed our warning. The profile found in this pre-workout is formulated for extreme potency and the "if a little is good, then more is better” way of thinking is not advised with this pre-workout powder. What Makes The New Apollon Nutrition Hooligan so Strong? It's stronger than the previous version which caused hysteria in the supplement industry! The one before that pissed everyone off. The one before that basically torched the entire category. Our original was the biggest F%^& YOU to an industry full of "me too" garbage. We kicked our own ass with this version! As mentioned above, the precise mix of ingredients found in this pre-workout powder is what increases the strength and gives you BALLS to throw weight around like an animal. This unique array of ingredients work together to enhance the overall effect felt during your intense workouts. In fact, they may scare you and it's DMAA free. WTF RIGHT? Are you still interested? Then step up and mix it up. Hooligan is the right choice. We didn't compromise and we're here to DOMINATE.

That being said, you should proceed with caution when using our new and improved formula. Bare Knuckle is not your average pre-workout powder – IT WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE WITH POTENCY. While one scoop is the recommended serving size due to the potency, it would be wise to start with half a scoop to assess your individual tolerance. Maybe even less if you've taken some weak garbage from "legacy brands." You may be thinking to yourself, "Eh, I can start with the full serving – I can handle it.” That is until this demanding pre-workout kicks in and says "LET'S GO MOTHERF$%^ER! Again, heed our warning. The profile found in this pre-workout is formulated for extreme potency and the "if a little is good, then more is better” way of thinking is not advised with this pre-workout powder EVEN THOUGH IT’S STIMULANT FREE. As mentioned above, the precise mix of ingredients found in this pre-workout powder is what increases the strength and gives you the non-stimulant EDGE to crush anything you want to in the gym. This unique array of ingredients work together to enhance the overall effect felt during your intense workouts. In fact, they may scare you and ALL WITHOUT STIMULANTS! Are you still interested? Then step up and mix it up. The all new Hooligan Bare Knuckle is HERE. We didn't compromise and we're here to DOMINATE.

Fully loaded for maximum liver support* Supports natural detoxification pathways* Protection from cellular stress-induced damage* Zero fillers 100% transparent label We love the grind. We train hard. We eat right...most of the time. And, we show up every damn day, come rain or shine. We know that fueling our bodies and getting enough sleep is essential to optimal performance and wringing out every last ounce of muscle & strength. But, having bulging biceps or a shredded midsection isn’t all there is to health and wellness. Your organs play just as important of a role in helping you achieve and maintain all aspects of what it takes to be a bad-ass. The liver especially takes a beating as it serves as a master filter of the blood, preventing contaminants from circulating in the body. Liver Lover was engineered to support all aspects of a healthy liver. Supplying an impressive 1200mg of NAC + 300mg of TUDCA would easily qualify this as one of the premier liver support supplements on the market. But, we didn’t stop there. We also included 1000mg of milk thistle and 1000mg of reishi mushroom to support the body’s natural anti-inflammatory and detoxification pathways. LIVER LOVER™ is safe for men and women and offers an excellent solution for active individuals seeking supreme liver support!

- [Egg-cellent  - Premium Grade Pure Egg Protein Powder](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/eggcellent-premium-grade-pure-egg-protein-powder): Whey protein has been the “gold standard” for protein powder for decades. And, it’s hard to argue with that. Whey digests quickly, offers high bioavailability, contains all the essential amino acids needed for muscle recovery & growth and tastes delicious. But, here’s the thing… So does egg protein. In fact, egg protein is considered by many to be nature’s “perfect” protein. Egg protein (like whey) offers high bioavailability, has a high leucine content, supports muscle recovery, and digests efficiently. Unfortunately, most egg protein powders are overly salty and/or “eggy” tasting. That’s exactly why we created Egg-Cellent. What is Egg-Cellent? Egg-Cellent is an egg white protein powder crafted for those who refuse to settle for mediocrity. Every scoop boasts an unparalleled amino acid profile, ensuring that your body receives the building blocks it craves for strength, recovery, and muscle growth. New & Improved Flavors Gone are the days of thin, salty and eggy-tasting protein shakes. Egg-Cellent redefines the egg protein powder market. Each scoop is an experience, infused with the delicious flavors that keep your workout as satisfying as your post-workout treat. You now have the option of three extremely decadent flavors in: ● Chocolate Marshmallow ● Salted Caramel ● Strawberry Cream Same Protein, Fewer Calories Not only is Egg-Cellent better tasting than ever, it’s leaner than ever! We’ve cut the fat so that the new and improved Egg-Cellent still delivers a staggering 24 grams of pure protein per scoop at a mere 110 calories per serving! Wave goodbye to bland protein shakes with a distinctly (and sometimes unpleasant) “egginess” and say hello to indulgent richness that you genuinely look forward to! JUST THE FACTS ● 24 Grams Of Protein● 110 Calories / Serving● 3 Delicious Flavors● Transparent Label● Dairy Free & Gluten Free

- [Molotov - Non-stim Fat Burner & Powerful Thermogenic](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/molotov-non-stim-fat-burner-powerful-thermogenic): JUST THE FACTS AND NO BS! ● Intense thermogenic* ● Stimulant-free* ● Optimize metabolism* ● Aid body recomposition* ● Zero fillers ● 100% transparent label Few things in life deliver the sense of impending doom or infernal damnation like a molotov cocktail. A few simple ingredients, and you’ve got the makings of true terror. We’ve taken that same approach and mindset to MOLOTOV.MOLOTOV contains a seemingly simple, yet extremely potent, combination of ingredients to increase white-to-brown adipose tissue conversion, enhance energy expenditure, and (of course) ratchet up thermogenesis, ultimately helping you burn body fat. The “trick” was to accomplish these goals without relying on a suspect blend of questionable stimulants, which is what most fat burners on the market do. The end result is white-hot amalgamation of high-potency, non-stimulant ingredients to ignite the body’s metabolism into a full-blown inferno. MOLOTOV embodies everything you’d expect (and more) -- intense thermogenic power to help influence the pathways involved in lipolysis, beta-oxidation, and energy expenditure. Truth to our ethos, we’ve spared no expense in creating MOLOTOV as it’s packed with premium, branded-ingredients, including MitoBurn, Paradoxine, and CapsiMax alongside proven commodities in 2,000mg Acetyl L-Carnitine and 60mg GBB. MOLOTOV contains no caffeine and can be used standalone or stacked with CHAOS for a powerful 1-2 lipolyptic, thermogenic punch that will have fat feeling the burn!

- [Over The Top -  Full Spectrum Intra-workout](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/over-the-top-full-spectrum-intra-workout): Nutrition is vital to performance, recovery, and growth. The proper application of targeted nutrients around your workout significantly enhances: ● Power output● Stamina● Focus● Fatigue resistance● Hydration● Recovery Unfortunately, most intra-workout supplements are nothing more than a sprinkling of BCAAs (which may be better than nothing, but not by much according to research). Fed up with the state of subpar intra-workout supplements, we sought to engineer an intra-workout supplement for real athletes. Over the Top – The Athlete’s Intra-Workout OVER THE TOP delivers the ultimate training fuel for athletes looking to wreck the weights, smash PRs, crush the competition, and still have the gumption to go toe-to-toe with Lincoln Hawk (if you don’t catch the reference, do a quick search on Google, then go kneel in the corner of shame for not knowing). We’ve brought together an advanced blend of essential amino acids, premium carbohydrates, and research-backed ergogenics to help you train harder, last longer, recover faster, and take your performance OVER THE TOP! OVER THE TOP’s key ingredients have been shown in research to: ● Increase endurance & stamina● Enhance muscle force contractility● Delay the onset of fatigue● Improve maximal oxygen uptake capacity● Reduce delayed onset muscle soreness● Boost energy & ATP production● Amplify power & strength Now, let’s make something clear. If you like to insta-tweet, twerk, or create the perfect “inspirational” post for your 36 followers between sets, then OVER THE TOP is NOT for you. If your idea of “training” is walking on the treadmill for 30 minutes while FaceTiming your “boo,” then OVER THE TOP is NOT for you. If you're the badass MotherF***** that lives to push your limits every single time you enter the gym, OVER THE TOP is FOR YOU! Just the Facts ➢ 40 grams of performance-boosting carbohydrates, including Cluster Dextrin and D-Ribose➢ Over 18 grams of amino acids (including 10g of BCAAs) to fuel muscle recovery, growth, and hydration➢ 5 grams of creatine monohydrate➢ 2.5 grams betaine anhydrous➢ 450mg PEAK ATP®➢ 100mg Senactiv® We’ve also included all the essential electrolytes your body demands for optimal performance in and out of the gym. Quite simply, OVER THE TOP is the ultimate training fuel for serious athletes—whether you’re tackling MMA, CrossFit, or LEG DAY.

- [Furiosa - Performance Maximizing Pre-Workout Capsules](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/furiousa-pre-workout-capsules): The mark of any real sports nutrition company is the quality of its pre workout. Often among the first, if not the first, products released when a brand debuts, a well-formulated pre workout will endear a company to millions, while an unremarkable, utterly mundane pre workout ushers you to the corners of obscurity, of which there are many in the ever-expanding pre workout niche. By now, you know that Apollon Nutrition doesn’t f*** around when it comes to pre workout supplements. We’ve done them multiple ways -- caffeine-only, stimulant-free, focus-heavy, thermogenic, and more. Suggested Use FURIOSA contains everything needed for optimal performance, both on the field, in the gym, or at work. Due to the potency of this product, we suggest starting with a half-serving (2-3 capsules) and assessing tolerance before trying a full serving. Stacking Options While FURIOSA is a complete pre workout and productivity supplement, it may also be stacked with the following: Bare Knuckle Bloody Hell BloodSport

- [Mind Games - Neurocognitive & Longevity Optimizer](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/mind-games-neurocognitive-blood-flow-longevity-optimizer): Mind Games V2 isn't another generic nootropic for people seeking basic cognitive support. It's for those who understand that mental performance, focus precision, and cognitive resilience determine success in high-pressure environments where clarity matters most. This is comprehensive cognitive optimization through pharmaceutical-grade nootropic compounds, engineered by Pharmacist Marina Samborsky, PharmD, who brings clinical expertise and evidence-based formulation principles to neurological enhancement. JUST THE FACTS 1,000mg Organic Lion's Mane for neurogenesis and cognitive enhancement.† 1,000mg Alpha GPC (as GPCgold™) for cholinergic neurotransmitter optimization.† 500mg Sabroxy® Oroxylum Extract for memory and learning enhancement.† 200mg Velvet Bean Extract (98% L-DOPA) for dopaminergic pathway support.† 4 capsules per serving, 30 servings of cognitive excellence.† 100% Transparent Label 4 Capsules – Cognitive Dominance – Pharmaceutical Precision We didn't simply combine popular nootropic ingredients and call it comprehensive. Every serving delivers clinically-researched compounds at therapeutic dosages based on peer-reviewed studies demonstrating cognitive enhancement benefits. The 1,000mg Organic Lion's Mane provides standardized hericenones and erinacines that stimulate nerve growth factor production, supporting neurogenesis and cognitive function through validated neuroprotective mechanisms. Alpha GPC at 1,000mg (as GPCgold™) represents the gold standard for cholinergic enhancement, delivering bioavailable choline that crosses the blood-brain barrier to support acetylcholine synthesis. This isn't generic Alpha GPC—it's a patented, pharmaceutical-grade formulation with documented bioavailability and cognitive benefits validated through human clinical trials. The inclusion of 500mg Sabroxy® provides clinically-proven cognitive enhancement through oroxylin A standardization, supporting memory formation, learning capacity, and mental clarity. Velvet Bean Extract at 200mg delivers standardized L-DOPA for dopaminergic pathway optimization, supporting motivation, focus, and cognitive reward systems. Additional premium ingredients including Zynamite® S Mangifera Extract (150mg), CognatiQ® Coffee Arabica (100mg), and Saffron Extract (30mg) provide sustained mental energy, neuroplasticity enhancement, and mood optimization for comprehensive cognitive support. Formulated by Pharmacist Marina Samborsky, PharmD, co-founder of Apollon Nutrition and owner of Apollon Gym, Mind Games V2 represents the same scientific rigor and clinical precision that built her reputation in pharmaceutical development. This isn't about general cognitive wellness it's about systematic neurological optimization for those who demand peak mental performance. Whether you're optimizing cognitive function for academic performance, supporting mental clarity during high-stress situations, or enhancing focus for professional demands, Mind Games V2 delivers pharmaceutical-grade results through evidence-based ingredient selection. The reality is clear: most nootropic supplements rely on underdosed ingredients rather than clinical evidence. Mind Games V2 refuses these compromises by providing therapeutic dosages of premium compounds with documented cognitive enhancement benefits. Your mind processes thousands of decisions daily. Optimize every thought with pharmaceutical-grade cognitive enhancement.

- [Hydration & Recovery - Premium Electrolyte Endurance Formula](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/hydration-electrolyte): Hydration is an important, yet overlooked, aspect of performance, recovery and results. Even minor dehydration can accelerate the onset of fatigue, impair concentration, reduce performance, and increase the likelihood of injury. While there has been an explosion of electrolyte supplements over the past several years, by and large, they’re underdosed and lack key electrolytes that significantly impact performance and recovery. That’s why we created Hydration + Recovery in the first place! True to form, we’re never one to rest on our laurels, which led us to find ways to improve an already stellar hydration product. And, DAMN, if we didn’t do it again! Apollon Nutrition Hydration + Recovery v2 is bigger, badder, and better tasting than ever! We’ve overhauled our flavor offerings. You’ll now get to between three refreshing flavors: ● Mango passion fruit ● White grape ● Orange pineapple In addition to improving our flavor offerings, Hydration + Recovery v2 also doubles the dose of pink himalayan salt and Aquamin and swaps Spectra for Senactiv (a unique plant-based ingredient that aids natural energy levels and preserves muscle cells via senescent cell clearance). Enjoy a serving of Hydration + Recovery v2 anytime of day -- in the morning, between meals, pre workout, intra workout, etc. You can even add a scoop to your clear whey isolate post-workout shake! JUST THE FACTS ● Optimized electrolyte blend for advanced hydration support† ● Premium minerals offering superior bioavailability† ● Natural energy† ● Antioxidant support† ● Improved recovery† ● Zero fillers† ● 100% Transparent Label

- [Glucovantage - Premium Dihydroberberine GDA](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/glucovantage-dihydroberberine): Berberine has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese practices to support cardiometabolic health. Research notes that, in addition to supporting healthy blood sugar and lipid levels, berberine may also impart antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, too.However, as great as berberine is, it requires a large dose (1500mg) spread across multiple dosings per day (usually 2-3x per day). On top of that, many individuals report adverse GI effects from larger doses of berberine.GlucoVantage (dihydroberberine) offers a superior alternative. It is a natural metabolite of berberine that offers the same benefits as berberine but at a much lower dose and without the unwanted (unexpected) GI upset. In other words, GlucoVantage is berberine advanced.

This doesn’t refer just to cars. You have various cost-effective go-to pre workouts throughout your lifestyle -- It’s your computer setup that helps you knock out work, the coffee mug you continue to refill as the day wears on, the lifting straps you always have packed and at the ready for the gym. Just the Facts Reliable Energy Elite Performance Hyper Focus Legendary Pumps It stands to reason that you’d have a pre workout that you can rely on for a great workout, every workout. Now, don’t confuse cost-effective go-to pre workouts with the cracked-out stim bombs you chug after a night of 4 hours of sleep and a raging hangover (these pre workouts also have their place, but hopefully they’re used sparingly). No, a cost effective go-to pre workout is the one that day in, day out, you mix up, drink, and BAM! You’re ready to seize the day. Desperado is the cost-effective pre workout Apollon style. True to Apollon form, we’ve packed out the performance and focus but keep the energy “moderate” (at least by our standards, which is to say it’s “high” for 90% of other brands). With Desperado, you get it ALL -- energy, performance, pumps, and focus -- while being a cost-effective solution to fuel your daily training!

- [Greens](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/greens): Greens -- love 'em or hate 'em, you can't deny that they offer numerous benefits. Despite the mountains of evidence supporting their inclusion in the diet, most people following the standard American diet don't meet the suggested daily intakes. This can be due to many reasons, including the way greens are usually prepared (i.e. boiled to death, making them taste like day-old pencil shavings soaked in week-old soup). Thankfully, modern food practices have found a way to preserve the most beneficial components of greens without having to choke down cans of boiled asparagus or spinach. Apollon Greens offers a robust, nutrient-dense greens supplement replete with scientifically-validated dosages of renowned health-promoting foods, including spirulina, VitaCherry, Peak02, grape seed extract and probiotics. Apollon Greens vs the "competition" Let's be real...the vast majority of greens blends on the market (including many "best sellers" on Amazon) contain a pixie-dusted (cough "underdosed") amount of buzzword ingredients, yet you, the consumer, has no idea how if any one of these ingredients is dosed properly or offering any tangible benefit. Don't you think you should know what you're getting for your hard-earned money?! We sure as sh*t do! That's why Apollon Greens contains a transparent label with research-backed dosages of clinically studied ingredients! Apollon Greens: The True Athletic Greens for REAL Athletes Apollon Greens doesn't need overpaid podcast hosts and charlatans to hype our product. Our formula speaks for itself. Every serving includes robust doses of transparently dosed greens, mushroom, and vegetable powders backed by hard science and tested by actual athletes. Have a serving each day to support your nutritional needs and help boost energy levels, improve feelings of well-being, support organ health, and promote a healthy inflammatory response.* Just the Facts and NO BS!

- [Clear Protein](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/clear-protein): The benefits of whey protein are undeniable. It’s effective for supporting muscle growth, fat loss, and overall health. There’s a reason it continues to be a staple supplement year in and year out among gym rats. Protein powder consumption has also exploded among more casual fitness enthusiasts as the mainstream audience learns the importance and power of protein. Traditional protein shakes are rich, thick, and creamy tasting. These dessert-like powders are fantastic, but what about those times when you’re not in the mood for an ultra-decadent shake, like when summer rolls around and temperatures are routinely in the upper 90s and 100s. Chugging an indulgent shake isn’t the most enticing prospect. At the same time, though, having a quick, affordable, and delicious high-protein shake is incredibly convenient. So, we sought to create a whey protein shake that offers all the same benefits as traditional whey protein powder but with a light, refreshing, and juice-like flavor. The result was clear … Apollon Clear Protein We start with the king of protein -- whey protein. It’s cross-flow, ultra nano-filtered and cold-processed. This unique process creates a light and refreshing protein drink that’s more juice-like than your typical thick, creamy protein shake. In true Apollon fashion, we created not one, but three juicy clear protein flavors in: ● Blue Raspberry ● Kiwi Strawberry ● Watermelon Apollon Clear Protein Benefits ● 22 grams protein per serving ● 90 calories per scoop ● Light, refreshing taste ● Easy mixing ● Rich in BCAAs Why Use Apollon Clear Protein? Consuming enough protein each day is vital, regardless of your goals, be it muscle building, fat loss, body recomposition, sports performance, or general health and well-being. Without adequate protein, your body lacks the critical building blocks (essential amino acids -- EAAs) it needs to repair muscles, build new muscle tissue, synthesize hormones, and nourish healthy hair, skin & nails. Is it possible to get all of your protein from “whole” foods? Absolutely, and for the record whey protein is a whole food. It’s just that sometimes we’re short on time (and maybe slacked on our meal prep) and we need something on short notice. Apollon Clear offers a simpler, more convenient, and affordable means to hitting your protein goal that requires no cooking and very little prep or clean up. How Does Clear Protein Taste? Apollon Clear offers a clean, refreshing and fruity flavor with a juice-like texture. Is Clear Protein Better (or Worse) Than Whey Protein? Clear protein powder is whey protein, meaning it offers all the same benefits -- high bioavailability, speedy digestion, complete essential amino acid profile, naturally high in BCAAs, etc. The difference between clear protein and “conventional” (milky-tasting) whey protein is that Apollon Clear undergoes a special process that enhances clarity and creates a neutral base (aka non-milky taste). To this we add our unique flavoring, thereby creating light, fruity, and refreshing flavors that can be enjoyed anytime of day or season of the year. How to Use Apollon Clear Protein Apollon Clear Whey is light, refreshing, and juicy-tasting. Use a scoop pre-workout, post-workout, or any other time during the day to nourish your muscles, quench your thirst, and satisfy your cravings for something sweet.

- [Glutamine 5g](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/glutamine): Glutamine has been a popular supplement for decades. Initially positioned as an important muscle building and recovery supplement (since ~80% of the body’s glutamine is found in skeletal muscle tissue), it turns out this conditionally essential amino acid’s benefits extend beyond athletics and aesthetics. In fact, glutamine is known to play a key role in gut health, immune function and recovery from severe trauma. So, why aren’t more companies touting the more meaningful benefits of glutamine? Two main reasons: Their supplement contains a pitifully low amount of glutamine They use an inferior form of glutamine We’ve solved both of those problems with the release of Apollon Nutrition Glutamine. In true Apollon fashion, our Glutamine supplement goes above and beyond. You’ll get 100 servings at 5,000mg per serving -- that half a kilo of pure L-Glutamine! But, we didn’t use just any generic glutamine. Apollon Nutrition Glutamine uses AjiPure® Glutamine Why AjiPure® Glutamine? AjiPure amino acids offer unparalleled quality and purity, especially to generic forms of glutamine. For starters, AjiPure® amino acids are 99-100% pure. Impurities found in other brands of amino acids can be as much as six times higher! AjiPure® L-Glutamine is milled 7x. This creates a very fine powder for increased solubility in beverages, allowing for greater uptake and benefit. Lastly, AjiPure® uses NO animal products, NO fillers, and NO shortcuts. AjiPure amino acids (including L-Glutamine) are produced via a patented Ferment-A-Pure Technology. This allows individuals following a vegan or plant-based diet to get the benefits of Glutamine, since many generic forms of glutamine are synthesized from hair or feathers. More About Glutamine Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid, which means under normal circumstances the body can produce enough glutamine to meet demands. However, during times of extreme stress, trauma or illness, glutamine demand may exceed supply. This is when having a high-quality glutamine supplement can be beneficial. In our bodies, glutamine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, helps support increased cell volume and aids glycogen replenishment. It also serves as an important source of energy for the cells that line our gut. Lastly, glutamine helps combat catabolism and has been shown to support healthy immune function. When to Use Apollon Nutrition Glutamine For enhanced post-workout recovery: mix one serving of Apollon Nutrition Glutamine with a serving of 50/50 Formula-X (or other Apollon Nutrition protein) + a serving of Creatine X. For gut health and immune support: consume one serving of Apollon Glutamine with breakfast and one serving with dinner. Just the Facts ● Supports gut health† ● Supports healthy immune function† ● Supports muscle recovery† ● Preserve lean muscle mass† ● 100 servings.† ● Zero fillers.†

- [Some Like It Hot](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/some-like-it-hot): Do you meticulously track your calories? Do bust your ass in the gym? Do you still have stubborn, unsightly body fat on your hips, abs, chest or butt? We’re right there with you. Despite doing all the “right” things, you’re left feeling frustrated, demotivated, and pi**ed off! The “good” news is that stubborn fat is stubborn for a reason -- it’s tucked away in areas of the body with lower blood supply. This means it’s harder for your body's fat-burning hormones to access them for energy production (and subsequent fat loss). As always, Apollon Nutrition is here with the solution you need to get the lean, toned, and muscular physique you so desperately desire (and save your sanity in the process!). It’s time to crank up the heat with Some Like It Hot!What is Some Like It Hot?Some Like It Hot is a maximum-strength thermogenic gel to chisel, tone and sculpt. We’ve worked with experts in the field of topical fat loss creams to develop a unique formula that delivers results without the drawbacks of other weight loss gels. The ingredients in Some Like It Hot help to increase heat production (thermogenesis), promote blood flow, and help the body access those stubborn fat reserves so you can shed those unwanted pounds, revealing lean, hard muscle. Unlike other reduction creams that feel thick and greasy, Some Like It Hot glides on smoothly and dries rapidly. This product is ideal for use in combination with rigorous dieting, fasted cardio, and serious resistance training.

- [Apollon Gym Classic](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/apollon-gym-classic): A well-formulated pre workout plays a key role in your ability to push hard during your workouts and get results. Like everything in life, you get what you pay for, which means just one serving of a quality pre workout costs $3-4. Considering that the average tub contains 20-25 servings, you’re going to spend at least $60-90 per month! Now, for some individuals this is a worthwhile investment, but for many individuals, this simply isn’t practical or fiscally responsible. That means turning to “budget” or “sport” pre workouts, which cost around $1 per serving. Now this may seem like a great option, but what you’re paying for is packaging, flavoring, and caffeine. All of the actual focus, hydration, pump and performance supplements are included at a fraction of their efficacious dosage. So, what’s the budget-conscious, results-focused lifter supposed to do? Trust that Apollon Nutrition has your back! Introducing Apollon Gym Classic! What is Apollon Gym Classic?Apollon Gym Classic offers an affordable solution that doesn’t compromise on quality or effectiveness.

- [Fiber Fuel](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/products/fiber-fuel): Raise your hand if you look forward to eating vegetables everyday? If you raised your hand, congratulations…you’re in the select minority of people that probably get enough fiber and micronutrients each day through their diet. But, if you’re like the vast majority of the population, you grudgingly eat a pittance of plant foods each day, because (let’s be real) charred animal flesh tastes a hell of a lot better than vegetables. While meat is rich in protein and healthy fats (aside from being damn delicious), it’s woefully low in fiber, which can offer a number of benefits in regards to gut health, immune function, and overall performance. Naturally, we think of fiber supplements as a way to fulfill this need, but conventional fiber supplements can lead to bloating, gassiness, excessive trips to the bathroom, and low energy. Besides, who wants to feel like their about to s*** their pants in the middle of a set of squats?! No, thank you… But, the right fiber supplement can help to support gut health, “grease the tracks” and efficiently shuttle waste and toxins from the body. Say hello, to Apollon Nutrition Fiber. The Apollon Nutrition Difference Apollon Nutrition Fiber utilizes an advanced blend of FOUR prebiotic fibers that help with regularity, support healthy metabolism, and fortify the gut microbiome. Unlike other fiber supplements which leave you feeling bloated or gassy, Apollon Nutrition Fiber mixes easily into water (or your favorite beverage) and has a clean taste. Apollon Nutrition Fiber is naturally sweetened, no sugar added fiber and gut health supplement scientifically formulated to nourish the microbiome, promote healthy digestion, and facilitate greater nutrient absorption. Just the Facts ● Promotes Digestive Health ● Nourishes the Gut Microbiome ● Supports Healthy Metabolism ● Support Bone & Immune Health ● Reduces Feelings of Hunger ● Increases Satiety ● Enhances Weight Loss Goals

It was the first time Branch got to train at the hardcore gym in Edison, NJ. In the days following the seminar, we paired up Branch with Team Apollon's Ukrainian IFBB Pro Kirill Khudaiev who is just a few weeks out from his Classic Physique show. Kirill is strong is his own right, so he made the perfect training partner for an arms workout powered by Apollon's new Bloody Hell extreme blood pumping formula. Go behind the scenes at Apollon Gym as Branch shows Khudaiev how to dial up the intensity Texas Titan style.</span>

  - [Whey Protein Isolate + Casein Protein = A Match Made in Muscle Heaven](https://www.apollonnutrition.com/blogs/blog/whey-protein-isolate-casein-protein-a-match-made-in-muscle-heaven): When it comes to protein, consumers tend to have their favorite brands and types.  Some prefer to go with a fast-digesting, straight whey protein concentrate which can save some money knowing that the overall quality isn’t the best.  If someone wants a higher-quality protein, they will tend to gravitate towards an evenfaster-digesting whey protein isolate.  While both of those types of protein are fast to be broken down and absorbed, you also have casein protein that is used as a slower-digesting protein.  But what happens when you combine a slow and a fast-digesting protein?  <em>That’s where the magic happens!</em>
