- [Ear Clean Gold for Dogs](https://pwb-staging.myshopify.com/products/dog-ear-mites): Could your dog benefit from Ear Clean Gold? Gentle & effective routine ear cleaner Prevents swimmers ear from swimming or bathing Rids ears of ear mites Helps dislodge excess wax and debris Order Ear Care Gold today! Its natural solution can keep your dog's ears clean and clear of debris and wax build up. 1 bottle = 2oz (59 ml) 90 Day money-back guarantee What is Ear Clean Gold? Ear Clean Gold is an infused herbal oil formulated for cleaning dogs' ears comfortably and naturally. The base oil of this formula is medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, known for its ability to keep skin tissue healthy and provide nutrition to the layers of the skin. Furthermore, this oil helps to maintain the natural immunity of the skin, assisting the skin's barrier capability often needed by canines prone to ear problems. Use Ear Clean Gold for regular maintenance or as needed. What is Ear Clean Gold Used For? It is common for many dogs to experience discomfort in the ears and some canine breeds are certainly more prone to this. Ear scratching, head shaking, redness and swelling are all indications that your dog's ears are uncomfortable and require attention. Dogs with floppy or hairy ears are more likely to require regular ear cleaning, as are dogs that swim. Ear Clean Gold helps swimmers' ear: Dry out the ears Change the pH in the ears Ear mites in dogs are most commonly passed on during contact with cats, while indoors or outdoors. The ears will be uncomfortable and you will notice your dog trying to relieve the itchiness. There may be redness and inflammation. You will also see a brown/black substance which may look waxy or like coffee grounds. The ears may have a bad odor. Use Ear Clean Gold prior to administering medicated preparations into the ear. Once the ear canal is free from debris and discharge, the tissues will be able to absorb more of the medication, making it more effective. A note from our veterinarian... Ear Clean Gold was designed to gently clean canine ears. The natural ingredients in this product support healthy skin and help maintain a clean, problem-free environment inside the ears. If there is evidence of chronic infections or discomfort in the ears, it is important to seek a consultation with your veterinarian. Recurrent canine ear problems may be a sign of underlying allergies, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease, diabetes or other causes. When cleaning the ears of your dog, be sure to never probe inside the ears with a Q-Tip or simular long instrument. This can lodge debris and discharge further into the ear canal or even rupture the eardrum. Be sure to follow the Directions for Use for the safety and comfort of your dog. What are Ear Mites? Mites spend most of their life living inside your dog's ear. Because outward signs are not always apparent, it is important to have your vet check your dog's ears at each regular check up. If untreated, canine ear mites can cause an ear infection through the abrasions created by the mites and from scratching. Ear mites are irritating and many dogs will scratch, causing reinfestation through the paws. Continued scratching can lead to bald patches where hair is torn out and even bleeding. At worst, the infection can spread to the brain, where it can cause very serious symptoms. Common symptoms of dog ear mites Ear scratching Head shaking Dark discharge similar to coffee grounds How soon will I see results? Every pet is different so results will vary depending on how advanced the infestation is, but you should see improvements anywhere from two days to a few weeks. Does it Come With a Guarantee? Yes!

Ear Clean Gold is Formulated With: Mullein leaf (Verbascum spp.): Mullein is effective at helping to keep the inner ear surface healthy. It enhances the body's innate resistance to infection and soothes the inner ear tissues with its slight demulcent quality. Calendula flower (Calendula officinalis): The beautiful orange petals of the Calendula flower are known for their ability to support the skin's natural resistance and ability to rejuvenate. Calendula is one of the most appropriate herbs for applying to wounds on the skin and for many types of skin discomfort. Rosemary leaf (Rosmarinus officinalis): Rosemary has been added as a minor ingredient in this formula to assist the ears' natural ability to stay free of bacteria and to act as a parasitic deterrent. Note that Ear Clean Gold contains Rosemary infused oil and not Rosemary essential oil, which could have potential toxicity to pets. 10% Vitamin E Oil (dl-alpha tocopherol acetate): Vitamin E is a fundamental component of providing the skin with nourishment. It helps to support the skin's ability to stay healthy after periods of scratching the ears that can cause abrasions. MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) Oil: MCT oil has the ability to effectively clean and support the daily health of the ears. It gently loosens wax and debris. The oil is made up of medium chain fatty acids, similar to the wax normally created inside the ear. It also enhances the ears' natural immunity to harmful bacteria, viruses and yeast. Our MCT oil is derived from coconuts and/or sustainably and ethically harvested palm kernel oil. Herbs are  organic or ethically wild-harvested.

- [Ear Clean Gold for Cats](https://pwb-staging.myshopify.com/products/cat-ear-mites): Could your cat benefit from Ear Clean Gold? Keep the ears' inner surface healthy Remove ear mites Use prior to administering Ear Care Gold or any ear medication Helps keep the ears free of debris Order Ear Care Gold today! Its natural solution can keep your cat's ears clean and clear of debris and wax build up. 1 bottle = 2oz (59 ml) 90 Day money-back guarantee What is Ear Clean Gold? Ear Clean Gold is an infused herbal oil formulated for cleaning felines' ears comfortably and naturally. The base oil of this formula is medium chain triglyceride oil, known for its incredible ability to keep skin tissue healthy and provide nutrition to the layers of the skin. Furthermore, MCT oil helps to maintain the natural immunity of the skin, assisting the skin's barrier capability often needed by cats prone to ear problems. Use Ear Clean Gold for regular maintenance or as needed. What is Ear Clean Gold Used For? Most felines do not require regular ear cleaning and are not generally prone to ear discomfort in the way many dogs are. If you notice your cat repeatedly scratching the ears, have a look inside. There may be ear mites present. Ear mites are a fairly common parasite found in the ears of cats. There will be a brown/black substance that looks waxy or like coffee grounds, apparent in the folds inside the ears. You may notice your cat shaking his or her head or scratching in an attempt to relieve the itchiness caused by the ear mites. A note from our veterinarian... Ear Clean Gold was designed to gently clean the ears. The natural ingredients in this product support healthy skin and help maintain a clean, problem-free environment inside the ears. If there is evidence of chronic infections or discomfort in the ears, it is important to seek a consultation with your veterinarian. Recurrent ear problems may be a sign of underlying allergies, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease, diabetes or other causes. When cleaning the ears of your feline, be sure to never probe inside the ears with a Q-Tip or similar long instrument. This can lodge debris and discharge further into the ear canal or even rupture the eardrum. Be sure to follow the Directions for Use for the safety and comfort of your cat. What are Ear Mites? Mites spend most of their life living inside your cat’s ears. Because outward signs are not always apparent, it is important to have your veterinarian check your cat’s ears at each regular check up. If untreated, feline ear mites can cause an ear infection because bacteria will have access to the ear tissue through abrasions (tiny holes) made by the mites. Because the ear mites are irritating, many cats will scratch, which can cause reinfestation through the paws. Continued scratching can lead to bald patches where hair is torn out and even bleeding. At worst, the infection can spread to the brain, where it can even cause very serious health problems. Common symptoms of feline ear mites Ear scratching Head shaking Dark discharge similar to coffee grounds How soon will I see results? Every pet is different so results will vary depending on how far advanced the infestation is but you should see improvements anywhere from two days to a few weeks. Does it Come With a Guarantee? Yes! Ear Clean Gold comes with a 90 day money-back guarantee. Why Choose Ear Clean Gold for Your Feline Friend?

For ear mites, treat every three days for a period of six to eight weeks. Use With Caution Does not require refrigeration. Do not insert cotton swabs into the ear canal. Use at room temperature or body temperature for the comfort and safety of the animal. Not for internal use. Do not use if ear drum is ruptured. For animal use only. Keep out of reach of children and animals. In case of accidental ingestion, contact a health professional immediately. Ear Clean Gold is Formulated With: Mullein leaf (Verbascum thapsus): Mullein is effective at helping to keep the inner ear surface healthy. It enhances the body's innate resistance to infection and soothes the inner ear tissues with its slight demulcent quality. Calendula flower (Calendula officinalis): The beautiful orange petals of the Calendula flower are known for their ability to support the skin's natural resistance and ability to rejuvenate. Calendula is one of the most appropriate herbs for applying to wounds on the skin and for many types of skin discomfort. Rosemary leaf (Rosmarinus officinalis): Rosemary has been added as a minor ingredient in this formula to assist the ears' natural ability to stay free of bacteria and to act as a parasitic deterrent. Note that Ear Clean Gold contains Rosemary infused oil and not Rosemary essential oil, which could have potential toxicity to pets. 10% Vitamin E Oil (dl-alpha tocopherol acetate): Vitamin E is a fundamental component of providing the skin with nourishment. It helps to support the skin's ability to stay healthy after periods of scratching the ears that can cause abrasions. MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) Oil: MCT oil has the ability, on its own, to effectively clean and support the daily health of the ears. It gently loosens wax and debris. The oil is made up of medium chain fatty acids, similar to the wax normally created inside the ear. It also enhances the ears natural immunity to harmful bacteria, viruses and yeast. Herbs are  organic or ethically wild-harvested.
