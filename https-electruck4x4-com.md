- [2022 California HOV Sticker Protection Film (PPF) (Set of 4)](https://electruck4x4.com/products/2022-california-hov-sticker-protection-film-ppf): Driving an electric truck in California is great. You get to use the HOV lane for free! The only downside is you are required to place an "HOV Access OK" sticker on your bumper. These stickers stick well, but a little too well, which often results in sticker remnants or even peeled paint when removed. You can prevent any peeled paint of leftover sticker residue by first applying a PPF sticker to your car as a base. The HOV sticker then goes over it. Then, when it's time to remove the HOV sticker, you can just peel them both off and voila! No damage to your truck's beautiful paint. Key features: 🛡 Protect your paint from the nasty adhesive of the HOV stickers. The bottom layer PPF allows you to install the HOV sticker on the PPF, and easily remove it by removing the PPF and keeping your paint spotless. 🏁 The tinted version adds an extra layer on top of the HOV sticker, which reduces its brightness (let's face it, that yellow is an acquired taste) 💪 Install in under 5 minutes. Install kit included. 💎 Precise digital cutout 🇺🇸 Made in the USA What's included: NOTICE: Actual HOV stickers are NOT included, you should request those from the DMV 4 x 2022 HOV Sticker cutouts - 2 big and 2 small Squeegee Spray bottle, pre-filled with soap Installation instructions + video

- [ARB Hydraulic Off-Road JACK](https://electruck4x4.com/products/arb-hydraulic-off-road-jack): What happens when engineers get creative and bring hydraulic technology into the recovery space? Theres little doubt that the traditional farm jack is a handy piece of equipment to have when you're driving off road. You can use it to move your vehicle out of awkward situations, lifting vehicles to fill in voids beneath the tires or even as a bead breaker when you have to make a tire repair. But, as we all know, farm jacks can be dangerous. They're inherently unstable and there are countless YouTube videos of users getting injured from a rogue handle or getting their hands caught between the handle and the body of the jack. With this problem in mind, ARBs team of engineers was determined to come up with a better solution to the unsafe farm jack problem. The focus was to design a safer and easier mechanical jack while being lighter and more compact. Adding a new dimension to traditional techniques, the long-travel ARB JACK is backed by the unique power of hydraulic technology. Kicking into action when even the lightest force is applied to the handle, the hydraulics will smoothly jack the vehicle up at .5in increments with each downward maneuver. While in action, a black rubber body bumper shields the vehicle from risk of damage during the recovery. The easy-to-access red lowering lever ensures lowering the vehicle is achieved swiftly and safely thanks to the two-stage descent feature and safety stop. With the press of a lever, the user is able to adjust the lower speed between a slow or rapid descent. Carefully designed on the basis of matching ergonomic form with safe and reliable functionality, the handles high position and top pivot function provides users with ultimate control while preventing the need to uncomfortably kneel down to operate. Standing true to its adaptable character, JACK features an adjustable foot that can be rotated 360-degrees via the shaft to match the angle of the terrain and reach a firm, stable connection between the base and ground. *Product returnable only if unopened

- [Imperfect Pano Roof Shades for Your Gen 1 Rivian R1T](https://electruck4x4.com/products/r1t-pano-shade-): We recently received a batch of panoramic roof shades for the R1T that, while very effective, aren’t perfect. These are the same great sun shades we normally  for $49.99. The one catch is that there is a slight gap (about 4mm) between the shade and the truck headliner at each corner. (See the photos for an example). If you are ok with this slight imperfection, this could be your chance to save big! We are offering these brand new shades, complete with retaining clips and storage bags, for less than half the price of our regular R1T panoramic sunroof shade. All sales are final and supply is limited. Don’t miss this opportunity to stay cool while saving some cash. ImportantThis product is for gen 1 R1 only.

- [MOLLE Nuts | Threaded MOLLE/PALS Fasteners](https://electruck4x4.com/products/molle-nuts-threaded-molle-pals-fasteners): BuiltRight MOLLE Nuts are the ultimate 'nice to have'. For years, we've had customers reaching behind panels with a wrench and/or using large washers to mount things in the larger MOLLE openings in each panel. Save time, save your knuckles and unlock even greater adjustability when using your BuiltRight MOLLE panels. These ‘MOLLE Nuts’ fit into the MOLLE/PALS openings in the BuiltRight Industries panels and offer two main advantages. Clamps, straps and other attachments can now be attached to the BuiltRight Industries panel system without having to reach behind with a tool. This saves time and knuckles. Being able to used the center of the MOLLE feature as a rigid mounting point means that you now have mounting points every inch vertically, instead of every two inches (the standard slot spacing). As a bonus, the narrow design of the MOLLE Nuts offers some side to side movement for finer resolution in the placement of your gear. Our latest revision includes 3 threaded holes: 1/4-20, #10-24 and #12-24. Kit Includes: 4x CNC Machined Stainless Steel MOLLE Nut 4x 1/4-20 x 5/8” Flanged Bolt 4x 1/4-20 x 1” Flanged Bolt 4x 1/4” Washer 4x 1/4"-20 Locking Nut Installation Process: Installation is straight forward. Simply slip the MOLLE nut behind the panel (often through the very same opening that you'll use it in) and then rotate it into position. The piece should stay in place by just holding it against the panel, allowing you to thread into it with a 1/4-20 bolt to secure your gear

- [Air Compressor Hose Winder](https://electruck4x4.com/products/air-compressor-hose-winder): This one is pretty much what it says on the tin and shows in the video! This thing honestly works great. It's pretty quick to wrap things up and toss back in the bag. If you're like me and your back seat is full of car seats - that under-seat storage isn't an option and it's gotta go back. This thing has been a game changer for me!

- [Key Fob Surround for GEN 1 Rivian R1T & R1S](https://electruck4x4.com/products/key-fob-surround-for-rivian-r1t-r1s-1): If you're anything like us, the "carabiner" that comes with the Rivian key fob is a nuisance, rather than a benefit. This CNC'd aluminum replacement sets out to solve that problem. It looks great, feels great in the hand, and adds a basic key ring so you can slap whatever carabiner you want on there, or just attach it to your key ring without worrying that it's going to slip off at some point. It does require disassembling your existing key fob (step by step video to come) - but rest assured, it's an easy process. Unlike Henry Ford, we think there should be some color options - however, the price gets extremely expensive without minimum order quantities (MOQs). Full transparency - the product validation tests we ordered were hundreds of dollars each. We’ve received enough interest in all colors to make sure all are produced! We placed the order with our manufacturer in early November and expect delivery in early/mid December. My sincere hope is to ship all orders in time for Christmas delivery, but cannot guarantee given tight time constraints.Note: For Gen 1 vehicles only

- [Camp Speaker Drawer Replacement for Rivian R1T/R1S](https://electruck4x4.com/products/camp-speaker-drawer-replacement-for-rivian-r1t-r1s): While we all love an adventure with our Rivian, truth is most of the time we don't really use the built-in camp speaker. For those of us, who'd rather use the space as an off-sight storage drawer, this is the perfect solution. Made with strong ABS (right here in California), our Camp Speaker Drawer Replacement will fit perfectly in the place of the camp speaker. While our drawer latches the same way the speaker does, have in mind that the locking mechanism is controlled by the car's software, and as it currently stands - the drawer won't lock. So while it's a nice place to store items that won't be visible, it's recommended that you don't use it as a safe, because it's not.

We've designed replacement covers in case you've lost yours. Notice: Rivian's design is such that these are mostly held by magic and a little tension. The replacements may fall off just as well as the originals. The original covers have a hook like thing that will keep them attached to your vehicle if they fall off. That doesn't always work though. Ours don't have that, but to compensate for this we've designed them to fit tighter than the originals. This is sold as a set of 4.

- [Megawatt™ Performance Rock Sliders with Step for R1S (Both Gen 1 and Gen 2)](https://electruck4x4.com/products/megawatt™-performance-rock-sliders-with-step-for-gen-2-r1s): In stock and available for immediate delivery The Rivian R1 is the perfect vehicle to tackle the outdoors. It's high ground  and individual wheel control enable it to navigate rocky terrain with ease. Even the most capable vehicles and drivers, however, can get hung-up on rocks and logs, which can result serious rocker panel damage or worse. Rock sliders help guard against this off-road hazard to keep your truck protected. Unsatisfied with current Rivian offerings, a team of early owners and longtime off-roaders assembled to engineer the strongest rock slider on the market that can serve as an R1S running board, yet stand up to even the most punishing abuse. What they arrived at is the latest product from Megawatt™ performance products. Make no mistake, this product is a rock slider first with the added benefit of serving as a convenient Rivian step. Given the weight of the Rivian R1S, and the potential for extreme forces while off-roading, we felt a purpose-built protection solution be crafted first. Only then could added features like a running board step be added. The Rivian R1S has a curb weight of almost 7,100 lbs. That is close the weight of a Dodge RAM 3500 MegaCab. As such, we used proven slider methods for vehicles like these to benchmark the Megawatt™ Rivian R1S rock slider. We then adapted this formula to fit the lines and unique architecture of the Rivian. The result is not only a rock solid, highly functional slider, but a side-step that looks great. Note: This product fits both Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1S vehicles Installation instructions can be found here. MEGAWATT™ ROCK SLIDERS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ANALYSIS Feature MEGAWATT™ COMPETITOR 1 COMPETITOR 2 COMPETITOR 3 🔨 Construction ✅ Fully enclosed tubing ✅ Fully enclosed tubing ❌ Press broken sheet metal ❌ Press broken sheet metal Why It Matters: Sheet metal is often used because it costs less than enclosed tubing. Unfortunately, this folded structure relies on just a few corner welds that can split apart on impact. 🔩 Mounting Points ✅ Two rows of bolts ❌ One row offset ✅ Two rows of bolts ✅ Two rows of bolts Why It Matters: Single row mounting allows the slider to flex when pushed upward, leading to body damage. ⚙️ Rail Mounting ✅ Inline with frame ❌ Cantilevered outside ✅ Inline with frame ✅ Inline with frame Why It Matters: Offsetting mounts creates additional outside leverage when the rail is pushed up, which can cause flex and frame damage. 📏 Rail Thickness ✅ .188" ❌ .134" 🤷♂️ Undisclosed 🤷♂️ Undisclosed Why It Matters: Thicker rails withstand more force without crushing or bending. ⚡ Weld Type ✅ TIG ❌ MIG ❌ MIG ❌ MIG Why It Matters: TIG welding results in cleaner, stronger welds than MIG. 🛡️ Coverage ✅ Full wheel-to-wheel ❌ Mostly wheel-to-wheel ❌ Mostly wheel-to-wheel ❌ Mostly wheel-to-wheel Why It Matters: Partial coverage leaves vulnerable areas open to rock damage. 👢 Kick-out ✅ Yes ❌ No ❌ No ❌ No Why It Matters: Provides stepping platform, additional protection, and obstacle pivot point. 🔧 Underside Cover No No Yes No Why It Matters: Underside plating traps debris while providing only marginal protection. 💰 Price Point $$$ $ $$ $$ Why It Matters: Premium price reflects premium materials and construction. Megawatt™ vs. COMPETITOR 1 Falls Short: Single row mounting, cantilevered design Falls Short: Thinner material (.134" vs .188") Falls Short: MIG welds, partial coverage Falls Short: No kick-out design Megawatt™ vs. COMPETITOR 2 Falls Short: Sheet metal construction Falls Short: Undisclosed rail thickness Falls Short: MIG welds, partial coverage Falls Short: No kick-out design Megawatt™ vs. COMPETITOR 3 Falls Short: Sheet metal construction Falls Short: Undisclosed rail thickness Falls Short: MIG welds, partial coverage Falls Short: No kick-out design ENGINEERED FOR SUPERIOR STRENGTH Premium materials. Premium construction. Premium performance.

- [Bed Glider for Rivian R1T](https://electruck4x4.com/products/r1t-bed-glider-shipping-beginning-nov-1st): The Thunderbolt Adventure Supply Bed Glider for the R1T lets you easily access the depths of your truck bed, even if you’re running a rooftop tent or tonneau cover. Made of durable powder-coated aluminum, its low-profile design accommodates popular camping accessories, including the Dometic CFX3 35 or Yeti Tundra 65 cooler under the powered tonneau. The Bed Glider is split and hinged to allow easy access to the spare tire well. We found the OEM gas shocks for the spare tire well a bit anemic, so our kit includes upgraded shocks to enable your cover to lift more efficiently, even with the Bed Glider in place. (Of course, you’ll have to remove your cooler first). The Bed Glider installs without tools, and the 60/40 split can be self configured to either side of the bed. The integrated mounting pattern will accommodate e-track tie down fittings to secure small items in the bed (NOTE: for loads over 200LBS it is recommended that you use the Rivian truck bed tie downs and not rely solely on the Bed Glider e-track system). The R1T Bed Glider offers a fully distributed live load capacity of 500LBS and a distributed static load capacity of 1500LBS, making it a sturdy option for accessing your truck bed. Safety first, never stand on the glide, as the actively moving surface can cause you to fall. 50"W x 52.75"D x 1.2"H (provides 16.25" of  under the power tonneau cover) Weight: 40LBS Shipping lead time: Approximately 5 days

While the F-150 LightningEV shares its blades with the regular F-150, Rivian R1T and R1S blades don’t exist yet in many auto part store catalogs.
