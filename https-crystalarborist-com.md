The copper color is symbolic of Wealth, Stability, Groundedness, and Warmth. Roses have many symbolic meanings dependant on their color.Floriography has ancient roots, but was better established in the Victorian Era when people used flowers as subtle ways to convey their feelings. Before the Victorian Era flowers held symbolic meaning in ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and intertwined with their mythology. In the Ottoman Empire, flowers were used to carry secret messages.But going back to Roses in particular, a Copper Rose symbolizes Love, Beauty, and Enduring Effection. It can also represent Wealth, Elegance, and Sophistication. Copper Roses are symbolic of Affection, and because copper or metal can not wither or die, it symbolizes a Love that lasts. It is also associated with Positivity, and dispersing negativity.Clear Quartz has a similar link to the disposal of negative energy. Clear Quartz is a Healer that people have used for centuries in various ways. Clear Quartz itself does not symbolize Wealth, but it is thought to amplify intentions and is used in manifestation practices.Size: about two and a half inches long with the loop at the top. About one and a half inches wide.The chain that comes with it is 20 inches long, but can be adjusted to be shorter

Quartz has been used for many things. Besides jewelry, it has also been used to create the first spectacles and are used today in electronics for their piezoelectric properties (the phenomenon where a material can create an electrical charge, which allows for the conversion of energy).This Pendant is designed to showcase the gem itself, without so much wire. Due to the reduction of wire use, glue was necessary to hold the gemstone to the wire frame. I used waterproof glue, which should make the pendant more durable. In the shade the crystal has a slight irridescent shine.Quartz Pointed down is believed to help to relieve stress and tension, help with grounding, and direct unwanted vibrations away from the wearer.Size: about an inch and a quarter tall and about an inch wideThe chain is 20 inches long but can be adjusted to be shorter

Dream Catchers were designed to filter out negative energy and promote pleasant dreams. There are varied opinions about whether or not it is disrespectful to create a Dream Catcher, if you are not Native American. As I mean no disrespect to anyone, or their Culture, I did not want to make a Dream Catcher directly. This art was only created with good Intentions, and the hope that it may help someone to sleep better.I started by painting the colors of Sunrise and Sunset. This was meant to create contrast, as well as to symbolize the joining of opposites.I wanted to make something with a Triskelion. The Treskele or Triple Spiral, as a Triskelion is also known, is an ancient symbol going all the way back to Neolithic Times. The symbol has different meanings; the elements (earth, air, and water), the Triple Goddess, movement and progress, Infinity, and Connection. It is often associated with Protection, and warding off negative energies.As Dream Catchers tend to have a web-like design, to ensnare bad dreams, I used fishing line to weave a web around the main frame, and tied some moonstone beads to it. Unfortunately it is difficult to see the web in the resin, so I also looped together some silver colored aluminum wire. If my fishing line doesn't catch the bad dreams then hopefully my wire net will.I chose the gemstones for this piece to try and help promote restful sleep and pleasant dreams. Moonstone is said to promote Restful Sleep, and aid in dream interpretation. Red Agate is said to cure insomnia, and induce pleasant dreams. Red Agate has been used for centuries, as a stone of Protection, and to ward off negative energies. Citrine is associated with positive energy, and manifestation. Citrine is also said to bring Joy. Amethyst is often used for sleep to promote relaxation, improve sleep quality, and reduce anxiety.Inside of this Amulet/ Wall Decor is also 24k gold plated beads, some silver and bronze colored beads, and a couple of sequins to create a shiny gemstone effect. I put the red agate, citrine, and amethyst on their corresponding colors, so they are difficult to see. I added the other beads to add some more variation to the design.Lastly, most Dream Catchers have feathers. As I didn't have any false feathers on hand, and it's illegal to keep or sell wild bird feathers, I used discarded feathers that I found under my pet parakeet's cage. Each blue feather inside the resin is 100% natural and authentic, and ads a nice shine and texture to the piece. Feathers represent a connection to the Sky and Spirit World. In Dream Catchers, feathers are believed to help create a soft ladder to guide good dreams to the sleeper.Size: Roughly four inches in diameter
