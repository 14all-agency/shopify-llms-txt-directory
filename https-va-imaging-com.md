  - [Industrial polarization camera whitepaper](https://va-imaging.com/blogs/machine-vision-knowledge-center/polarization-camera-whitepaper): <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Daheng Imaging is familiar in the industrial polarized camera<strong> </strong>segment by implementing the Sony-IMX250 monochrome image-sensor. Recently the IMX264 has also been added to the portfolio. The Industrial polarization camera<strong> </strong>systems are able to capture information which a normal line or area industrial camera is not able to obtain. A polarization camera conducts a two-dimensional analysis. It measures both the degree and direction of the polarization of the light. As a result, the final image has almost no reflections from external light sources. A polarized camera is ideal for applications like the inspection of glossy products and transparent products.</span></p>

Unsharp images result in inaccurate measurements, bad fault detection or wrong classifications. Motion blur is caused by movement or vibration during the exposure time of the industrial camera. When the object moves for more than 0.5 pixel during the exposure time, the image will have motion blur.</span></p>

  - [Rolling Shutter vs Global Shutter](https://va-imaging.com/blogs/machine-vision-knowledge-center/faq-rolling-vs-global-shutter): <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Global shutter is used for capturing moving objects, while rolling shutter is used for capturing still images. A rolling shutter camera is cheaper, especially for resolutions above 1.6 Megapixel. For example, our 12MP rolling shutter camera costs approx. 200 euro: <a data-mce-fragment="1" href="https://va-imaging.com/products/usb3-0-camera-12-2mp-color-sony-imx226-mer2-1220-32u3c" title="MER2-1220-32U2C" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MER2-1220-32U3C</a>. In contrast, our 12MP global shutter costs approx. 1000 euro: <a data-mce-fragment="1" href="https://va-imaging.com/products/usb3-vision-camera-12-3mp-color-sony-imx304-me2p-1230-23u3c" title="ME2P-1230-23U3C" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank">ME2P-1230-23U3C</a>. A Global shutter has larger pixels, therefore a larger sensor as a rolling shutter camera. As a result, a global shutter camera is more light sensitive and produces sharper images.</span></p>
