## Products

- [A DOGS LIFE - 1 2 3](https://nessypopart.com/products/a-dogs-life-1-2-3): “I’m gonna swing…” and he does. Inspired by Sia’s iconic Chandelier, this piece finds our dog mid-swing on a light fixture, rainbow mop proudly atop his head like a party crown. It’s chaos, it’s joy, it’s pure canine abandon. Ness channels the spirit of the song’s opening countdown—1, 2, 3...—into a moment of wild celebration, where rules don’t apply and gravity’s just a suggestion. Available in 40×40 cm and 100×100 cm Choose Framed or Rolled For the ones who swing first and ask questions later.

- [ICON - Bowie](https://nessypopart.com/products/icon-bowie): Drawn the day Ness heard of David Bowie’s passing, this portrait marks the beginning of the ICON series—a spontaneous, emotional response to loss, legacy, and transformation. Signed Nessy – 2016, it captures Bowie not as one version of himself, but as a fusion of many: The Aladdin Sane lightning bolt, sharp and iconic The Ziggy Stardust flame-red hair, untamed and theatrical The raised hands, echoing Heroes era vulnerability and defiance Set against a saturated orange field, this piece radiates pop-art clarity and emotional depth. Ness didn’t just draw Bowie—she summoned him. The result is a composite myth, stitched from memory and reverence, inviting collectors to see Bowie as both icon and mirror. This was the first ICON. The one that cracked open the series. A moment of grief turned into a visual anthem for reinvention. Available in Open Edition formats: A4 (21 × 29.7 cm) A3 (29.7 × 42 cm) A2 (42 × 59.4 cm) For collectors who carry Bowie’s spirit in their own transformations, this print is more than art—it’s origin. Giclee print on fine art paper. Print only. Frames shown are for illustrative purposes and not included.

- [Hoodie Boy - Bullied](https://nessypopart.com/products/hoodie-boy-bullied): A jester crown sits crooked atop Hoodie Boy’s head — the artist’s recurring alter‑egoi —not in triumph, but defiance. Bruised but unbowed, he stands at the center of a chaotic chorus of pop culture ghosts and childhood echoes. Charlie Brown’s “Good Grief” floats nearby like a sigh too familiar. Inspector Clouseau stumbles through the margins, clueless to the cruelty. Keith Haring’s radiant baby beams in contrast, a symbol of innocence lost. This painting is a riot of color and commentary, channeling Basquiat’s raw energy but swapping royalty for jesters, heroes for survivors. Scribbled phrases, fractured symbols, and cartoon fragments swirl around Hoodie Boy like the noise of a thousand taunts. Yet he remains—scraped, scuffed, but still standing. Bullied is not just a portrait. It’s a protest. A memory. A mirror.

- [Hoodie Boy - Pills](https://nessypopart.com/products/hoodie-boy-pills): Hoodie Boy – Pills Hoodie Boy — the artist’s recurring alter‑egoi — grips a spray can, freshly tagging the word PILLS in dripping blood-red across the wall. It’s not graffiti—it’s a confession. A protest. A cry. The letters bleed like open wounds, raw and unresolved. Around him, the world spins in manic contradiction: Muttley cackles with cruel delight. Spy vs Spy lurks in monochrome tension. Felix the Cat grins through the static. Pac-Man chases ghosts that never die. The Monopoly cop watches, unmoved. A peace sign flickers. Keith Haring’s heart pulses. A lone figure waves. This isn’t just about medication—it’s about the storm inside. The characters aren’t random; they’re echoes of distraction, surveillance, nostalgia, and absurdity. Hoodie Boy doesn’t ask for permission. He paints the truth. This piece confronts the messy reality of mental health—the pills that help, the ones that numb, and the ones that simply exist in the background of survival.

The voluminous blonde waves, dramatic eye, and crimson backdrop evoke a lineage of glam queens: Debbie Harry’s icy defiance, Madonna’s sculpted provocation, Gaga’s own velvet menace. This isn’t Gaga the chart-topper—it’s Gaga the vampiric icon, the one who made horror couture. The bold lines and minimal shading amplify her mythic silhouette, rooted in the visual language of ICONS.

For collectors who believe in the power of sequins, sincerity, and piano ballads that break your heart and heal it in the same breath—this is your anthem in ink. Print only.

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Canine Gothic](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-canine-gothic-1): Two serious dogs. One very unserious pitchfork. In this cheeky riff on Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” Ness swaps solemn humans for dapper pups and replaces rural austerity with pop-colored joy. The heart pendant? Iconic. The glasses? Scholarly. The sausages skewered on the pitchfork? Utterly ridiculous. And perfect. Set against a sky of cartoon clouds and a barn that looks suspiciously like it moonlights as a doghouse, Canine Gothic is part homage, part howl-worthy parody. It’s a love letter to loyalty, odd couples, and the quiet comedy of domestic life. From the CANINE CLASSICS series—where every masterpiece gets a tail-wagging twist. Open Edition Prints now in 2 sizes 18 x 18 cm (7" x 7") 30 x 30 cm (12" x 12") Giclee print on fine art paper. Print only. Frames shown are for illustrative purposes and not included.

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Whistler's Doggie](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-whistlers-doggie): Stoic. Stylish. Slightly sulky. In this canine twist on Whistler’s Mother, Ness gives us a dog who’s mastered the art of quiet judgment. Seated in profile like a Victorian matriarch, this pup radiates dignity—with just a hint of “I told you so.” The backdrop? Minimal. The mood? Maximal. Whistler’s Doggie is all about restraint, poise, and the kind of emotional depth only a well-dressed dog can deliver. It’s a wink to art history and a nudge to anyone who’s ever been silently judged by their pet. From the CANINE CLASSICS series—where every masterpiece gets a tail-wagging twist.

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Howl](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-howl-1): A scream? A snack attack? A full-blown existential moment? In this canine parody of Edvard Munch’s The Scream, Ness channels pure emotional chaos—dog-style. Our hero lies belly-up in a swirl of color and crumbs, mid-howl, mid-mess, mid-meltdown. Two food bags lie torn beside him, evidence of a crime of passion (and hunger). With bold lines and cartoon drama, Howl turns angst into art and mischief into masterpiece. It’s a tribute to impulse, joy, and the kind of emotional honesty only a dog can pull off. From the CANINE CLASSICS series—where every masterpiece gets a tail-wagging twist.

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Son of Dog](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-son-of-dog-1): Dressed to impress. Obscured by chicken. In this surrealist send-up of Magritte’s The Son of Man, Ness swaps the classic green apple for a floating roast chicken—because of course he does. Our canine gentleman stands poised in bowler hat and red tie, his face hidden behind poultry perfection. Is it symbolism? Is it lunch? Is it both? Son of Dog is a delicious mystery—equal parts pop art, parody, and canine philosophy. It’s a nod to the unknowable desires of the modern mutt and a wink to anyone who’s ever been stared down by a dog mid-snack. From the CANINE CLASSICS series—where every masterpiece gets a tail-wagging twist. Open Edition Prints now in 2 sizes 18 x 18 cm (7" x 7") 30 x 30 cm (12" x 12") Giclee print on fine art paper.

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Dog with a Bone Earring](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-dog-with-the-bone-earing-1): She’s elegant. She’s mysterious. She’s probably just heard the treat jar open. In this canine homage to Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, Ness swaps the quiet gaze of a Dutch maiden for the wide-eyed wonder of a pup caught mid-daydream. Draped in a blue and yellow headscarf, with a bone-shaped earring dangling just so, she radiates poise with a hint of mischief. The red backdrop adds pop drama, while her expression says, “I’m listening… but also plotting.” It’s a portrait of canine grace, curiosity, and the eternal question: Is that snack for me?

- [CANINE CLASSICS - Modern Lisa](https://nessypopart.com/products/canine-classics-modern-lisa-1): She’s serene. She’s stylish. She’s definitely judging you. In this canine riff on da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Ness trades Renaissance mystery for pop-colored sass. With flowing hair, a heart pendant, and a lakeside backdrop that feels more weekend getaway than Florentine landscape, Modern Lisa is part icon, part influencer, all dog. Her crossed arms say “I’ve seen things,” while her expression says “...and I’m not impressed.” It’s a portrait of quiet power, emotional depth, and the kind of gaze that follows you around the room—especially if you’re holding snacks. From the CANINE CLASSICS series—where every masterpiece gets a tail-wagging twist. Open Edition Prints now in 2 sizes 18 x 18 cm (7" x 7") 30 x 30 cm (12" x 12") Print only.

- [Yoga](https://nessypopart.com/products/yoga): A spiritual awakening with calf definition. “Yoga” captures the sacred moment when inner peace meets outer pecs, and the only mantra is “don’t fall over.” Set against a backdrop of suspicious serenity, this piece invites viewers to contemplate balance, body hair, and the quiet dignity of stretching in front of a window. It’s not about enlightenment—it’s about commitment, delusion, and the occasional hamstring cramp.

With heroic body hair and a speedo that defies modesty, this painting asks: what if Baywatch was a one-man show and nobody was watching?

- [CANINE CLASSICS](https://nessypopart.com/collections/canine-classics): In CANINE CLASSICS, Nessy Pop Art transforms six iconic masterpieces into tail-wagging tributes to canine emotion, mischief, and charm. Each piece reimagines a cultural classic through the expressive lens of doghood—blending art history with pop color, surreal humor, and emotional truth.

Whether it’s quiet judgment, chaotic joy, or mysterious snack obsession, every work captures a moment of canine humanity that feels oddly familiar. Together, they form a mythic arc of loyalty, longing, and the eternal drama of domestic life. Perfect for collectors who love their art with a wink, a wag, and a generous helping of absurdity.

- [JETSONS](https://nessypopart.com/collections/jetsons): Step into the bubble-domed brilliance of tomorrow with this vibrant pop art series celebrating the Jetsons—America’s favorite space-age family. From Rosie’s chrome-hearted caregiving to Astro’s goofy loyalty, each piece captures a moment of animated tenderness, framed in retro-futurist optimism. At the heart of the collection lies a rare visual trilogy: three continuous canvases that, when displayed side by side, reveal the full Jetson household in motion.

Together, they form a panoramic portrait of cartoon family life—bright, whimsical, and emotionally resonant. Whether collected individually or as a complete set, these limited edition prints offer a nostalgic nod to mid-century dreams and the enduring charm of animated affection.
